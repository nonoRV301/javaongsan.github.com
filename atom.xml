    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
    I have been working on windows mobile for the last 10 years starting with VB 3.0 up to .NET. This is the first time I work on a consumer app. I have release an app called Skymusic. I found out that there are already another app named the same way.
</p>


<p>
    I have been using Omina 7 with Windows Phone 7.5. I have found that from time to time I am not able to sync my medias over. I have lots of music I would like to put on my phone. The fatest way would be from a could storage since most of my stuff are there. However there are very few apps that offers download to local from could especially from skydrive. So I build a simple app that could just do that.
    
    The live SDK was not that suitable for a job like this, its does not handles continuos donwload well. It woul be fine if I let select one file at a time for download or may be stream it on demand. I wanted to used wifi and download all the files when I have a fsater connection.
    </p>


<p>
    After 3 or maybe 4 days, my apps was rejected. I had to make some changes using the tips from <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/FromConceptToCodeIn6HoursShippingMyFirstWindowsPhoneApp.aspx">From Concept to Code in 6 hours: Shipping my first Windows Phone App</a>
    
    1. The app keep crashing when in continous download mode, I had to change the design to a click 1 item at time to download. 
    2. Replace my buttons with Coding4Fun Windows Phone Toolkit.
    3. Replace screenshots I capture using print screen with the one I took using <a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2011/10/screenshots-cs-how-to-capture-screenshots-of-your-app-on-your-device/">screenshots.cs&#8221;</a> from the crazy-useful Jeff Wilcox.
    
    Resubmitted the app and it was approved, but I mistakenly select $6.99 for pricing. 
    
    I made a website www.skymusicapp.com using the <a href="http://wp7appsite.codeplex.com/">One-Page Windows Phone 7 App Website Template</a> with <a href="https://github.com/raul/rack-static-boilerplate">rack static boilerplate</a> and hosted it on heroku.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Abstract Class Implementing Interface.</p>

<p>Recenlty I took a technically test and I have write an employee class for an aspx page that will
use an abstract class that implements an Interface.</p>

<p>What is abstract class ?
Abstract class is a base class or a parent class. Abstract classes can have empty abstract methods
or it can have implemented methods which can be overridden by child classes.</p>

<p>What are interfaces?
Interface is a contract class with empty methods, properties and functions.
Any class which implements the interface has to compulsory implement all the
empty methods, functions and properties of the interface.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Finally&#8230;we get Kindle ship to us outside of US. Amazon introduces a new addition to the Kindle family of wireless reading devices: <strong>Kindle with U.S. and International Wireless</strong>. With this new Kindle, you can receive your books, newspapers, and magazines wirelessly while at home or abroad in over 100 countries. Whether you&#8217;re in New York, Paris, SÃ£o Paulo, Mumbai, Beijing, Tokyo, or Sydney, you can think of a book and be reading it in less than 60 seconds. The $279 Kindle with U.S. and International Wireless can be preordered today for delivery starting in two weeks.</p>

<p>Kindle utilizes the same 3G wireless technology as advanced cell phones, so you never need to hunt for a Wi-Fi hotspot. Unlike cell phones, there are no monthly wireless bills and no yearly contracts. There is no software to install, and no syncing required.</p>

<p>The 8&#8221; x 5.3&#8221; x 0.36&#8221; Kindle is as thin as most magazines and weighs less than a paperbackâ€”but can hold 1,500 books. Its electronic-ink screen looks and reads like real paper with no glareâ€”even in bright sunlight. A long battery life means you can read for up to two weeks on a single charge.</p>

<p>You can order one <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00154JDAI?tag=YOUR_ID_HERE-20%20and%20http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015T963C?tag=wizcoder-20"> here</a></p>
