    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I been asking a few times to take equity instead of cash to help with the development of mostly startups or those who wants to do start up.
I would definitely take equity if a right project I like comes along.</p>

<p>My rules are :
1. If project have good potential and generates income right form the start, I take equity.
2. If project have good potential and may generate income in distant future, I take small equity plus small upfront cash.
3. If project have no potential, I charge full development cost.
4. Reject anything else thats a waste of time.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This month was my second year as a freelance programmer. This are somethings that have worked well.</p>

<h2>Recurring income</h2>

<p>Always ask for more work from existing client. Charge a monthly for maintenances if you can.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<p>Macbook air, Dell 23 inch have been the best investment ever. I hope to get a new MBA with more ram than the current 4g and a 27i nch Monitor thats now cost less than $500. A mac pro would be ideal but a spec up one is really costly.</p>

<h2>Skills</h2>

<p>C#, PHP and javascript are the most common skill I am using. I write a lot python scripts to process things.</p>

<h2>Networking</h2>

<p>I attended a lot more events and hackathons. I make some really good connections.</p>

<h2>learning</h2>

<p>I learn a lot of marketing techniques since.</p>

    <id>http://javaongsan.github.com/blog/2014/01/14/creating-a-reliable-lead-generation-channel-for-your-freelancing-business</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I started freelancing I did not have a constant flow of clients. I search job boards, forums and classified ads, there were not many jobs and it was hard to convert those prospects into clients. I didn&#8217;t know what to do.</p>

<p>Since then I have gather a few methods from various freelancer and marketers I came across that have work well.</p>

<h2>Define The Types of Client</h2>

<p>For me a good client will be someone for pays $5000 or more for a single project. Loosely translate to $500 per man-day charge. Anything less are just not worth the time and effort even if I have no income. Recurring revenue is another thing that I would focus on. Clients I take on should be coming back to me for more work.</p>

<h2>Lead Source</h2>

<p>Leads can be generated through:
1. On-line classified ads.
This are slow, and may generate 1 or 2 leads per month, but maintenances is easy. Most of the ads run for a month, then you go back and turn it on again. Use Google calender to set reminders, keep the url in the calender, so when an reminder is send, all you need to do is click the url.
2. Blog
It takes a lot effort to get ranked in the search engine. Some SEO knowledge required here
3. PPC Paid Ads
Using Adwords and facebook ads can generate the fastest and most relevant leads.
4. Linkedin
People are always looking for someone good in certain skill set. Setting up a good profile can help generate a fair amount of traffic</p>

<h2>Building the list</h2>

<p>Now you have gather all the source, you need channel them to a place where you can keep build relationships. Use an opt-in list builder like mailchimp. Set up a landing page to catch all that traffic. Set up an series of emails.</p>

<h1>Other more manual generation</h1>

<p>Responding to wanted ads, forum query and user groups and posting links back to your blog post which eventually end up on your landing page.</p>

    <id>http://javaongsan.github.com/blog/2014/01/13/freelancing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>More programmers are try their hands at freelancing full-time. They are driven by the dream to be independent and living without a 9-to-5 job constraints. Does a full-time freelancer get to work he you want, take vacations when you want, for as long as he wants. For me its not, I start freelancing 2 years ago, this are somethings I learn along the way. If you&#8217;re looking to start freelancing and not sure how you can go about it, then read on.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>Decide why you want to freelance. More time for family, more time for health, less commuting, no office politics, no more long boring meetings or the comfort of working from your own home. Knowing your motivation will help will go through tough times and taking full time employment again.</p>

<h2>Finding work</h2>

<p>The one most ask question I get when I introduce my self as a freelancer is &#8220;How to get work?&#8221;. Well, there are a few ways to find work:
1. Referral from a friends, family member, Ex-Employees, Ex-Colleagues or just about anyone you knows.
2. Your Website or Blog
3. From online job boards or on a freelance website like Elance, ODesk, or Freelancer.com
4. From online classified ads.
All of the above requires constantly looking, goggling, searching and talking to people. It will probably take up more time then development before you get your first 3 clients. I have the most success getting referrals from ex-colleagues and ex-employers.</p>

<h2>Whats my rate?</h2>

<p>The next most important thing is how much to charge? Working out how much to charge clients is very difficult. I would recommend you work out you hourly rate. Try this formula if you are having trouble determine you hourly rate. Take your highest monthly pay, divide it by the number of working days, divide the result by 8, then increase it by 20%. You should get a reasonable hourly rate. Remember if you have low rate, you have a hard time trying to raise it later on.</p>

<p>To sum it up, as a freelancer, your next paycheck is never guaranteed. You are always searching for your next project while you chase the payment of the previous one.</p>

    <id>http://javaongsan.github.com/blog/2014/01/13/getting-work-as-a-freelance-developer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How does one go about getting work as a Freelance developer? The number one question I get when I introduce my self as a freelancer is &#8220;How to get work?&#8221;. Most freelancer start out having no idea how to find new clients.</p>

<p>I have mention 4 ways to find work in the previous post:
1. Referral from a friends, family member, Ex-Employees, Ex-Colleagues or just about anyone you knows.
2. Your Website or Blog
3. From online job boards or on a freelance website like Elance, ODesk, or Freelancer.com
4. From online classified ads.
All of the above requires constantly looking, goggling, searching and talking to people. It will probably take up more time then development before you get your first 3 clients. I have the most success getting referrals from ex-colleagues and ex-employers.</p>

<p>Because all these looking and searching for new client may takes time, you will need a remember a few things when you get your client:
1. Keep existing client, generate recurring revenue form them, or at least keep the relationship going.
2. Keep billing organize, bill on time because chasing payments are painful.
3. Ask for referral from existing client.</p>

<p>Be the go to person for your expertise is the eaiuest way to get referral. Put effort in your work, give extra values. If you did a good job that client will tell others and getting new business will be easier.</p>

<p>What I am achieving is to create a lead generation channel, an automated system that constantly bring in and qualifies new clients. I share this in the future posts.</p>

<p>You need to think about what type of clients you want to work with. Find clients who wants your skill sets. Identify these clients? What sort of projects do they need completed? How they spend their time? Get your portfolio in front of them. If you know where they spend their time, you can contribute to the publications they read, meet them at the right networking events and even attend their industry conferences.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
    I have been working on windows mobile for the last 10 years starting with VB 3.0 up to .NET. This is the first time I work on a consumer app. I have release an app called Skymusic. I found out that there are already another app named the same way.
</p>


<p>
    I have been using Omina 7 with Windows Phone 7.5. I have found that from time to time I am not able to sync my medias over. I have lots of music I would like to put on my phone. The fatest way would be from a could storage since most of my stuff are there. However there are very few apps that offers download to local from could especially from skydrive. So I build a simple app that could just do that.
    
    The live SDK was not that suitable for a job like this, its does not handles continuos donwload well. It woul be fine if I let select one file at a time for download or may be stream it on demand. I wanted to used wifi and download all the files when I have a fsater connection.
    </p>


<p>
    After 3 or maybe 4 days, my apps was rejected. I had to make some changes using the tips from <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/FromConceptToCodeIn6HoursShippingMyFirstWindowsPhoneApp.aspx">From Concept to Code in 6 hours: Shipping my first Windows Phone App</a>
    
    1. The app keep crashing when in continous download mode, I had to change the design to a click 1 item at time to download. 
    2. Replace my buttons with Coding4Fun Windows Phone Toolkit.
    3. Replace screenshots I capture using print screen with the one I took using <a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2011/10/screenshots-cs-how-to-capture-screenshots-of-your-app-on-your-device/">screenshots.cs&#8221;</a> from the crazy-useful Jeff Wilcox.
    
    Resubmitted the app and it was approved, but I mistakenly select $6.99 for pricing. 
    
    I made a website www.skymusicapp.com using the <a href="http://wp7appsite.codeplex.com/">One-Page Windows Phone 7 App Website Template</a> with <a href="https://github.com/raul/rack-static-boilerplate">rack static boilerplate</a> and hosted it on heroku.

<p>Recenlty I took a technically test and I have write an employee class for an aspx page that will <br/>

Abstract class is a base class or a parent class. Abstract classes can have empty abstract methods <br/>
or it can have implemented methods which can be overridden by child classes.</p>

<p>What are interfaces?<br/>
Interface is a contract class with empty methods, properties and functions. <br/>
Any class which implements the interface has to compulsory implement all the <br/>
empty methods, functions and properties of the interface.</p>

    <id>http://javaongsan.github.com/blog/2011/03/28/lower-back-pain</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I been suffering form lower back pain for last 2 weeks which has disturbed my training schedule. I been having back problem for many years but it has been getting pretty bad for the past 2 years. It seems lack of strength training on the lower back is causing my muscles to tense up when it&#8217;s overuse. The tense up muscle affects the nerves near the spine area which cause a shooting pain to the lower butt and leg area. The only thing I can do is to get physiotherapy now and slowly strengthen my back before pounding on the training load.</p>
