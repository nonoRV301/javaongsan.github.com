    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
    I have been working on windows mobile for the last 10 years starting with VB 3.0 up to .NET. This is the first time I work on a consumer app. I have release an app called Skymusic. I found out that there are already another app named the same way.
</p>


<p>
    I have been using Omina 7 with Windows Phone 7.5. I have found that from time to time I am not able to sync my medias over. I have lots of music I would like to put on my phone. The fatest way would be from a could storage since most of my stuff are there. However there are very few apps that offers download to local from could especially from skydrive. So I build a simple app that could just do that.
    
    The live SDK was not that suitable for a job like this, its does not handles continuos donwload well. It woul be fine if I let select one file at a time for download or may be stream it on demand. I wanted to used wifi and download all the files when I have a fsater connection.
    </p>


<p>
    After 3 or maybe 4 days, my apps was rejected. I had to make some changes using the tips from <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/FromConceptToCodeIn6HoursShippingMyFirstWindowsPhoneApp.aspx">From Concept to Code in 6 hours: Shipping my first Windows Phone App</a>
    
    1. The app keep crashing when in continous download mode, I had to change the design to a click 1 item at time to download. 
    2. Replace my buttons with Coding4Fun Windows Phone Toolkit.
    3. Replace screenshots I capture using print screen with the one I took using <a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2011/10/screenshots-cs-how-to-capture-screenshots-of-your-app-on-your-device/">screenshots.cs&#8221;</a> from the crazy-useful Jeff Wilcox.
    
    Resubmitted the app and it was approved, but I mistakenly select $6.99 for pricing. 
    
    I made a website www.skymusicapp.com using the <a href="http://wp7appsite.codeplex.com/">One-Page Windows Phone 7 App Website Template</a> with <a href="https://github.com/raul/rack-static-boilerplate">rack static boilerplate</a> and hosted it on heroku.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Abstract Class Implementing Interface.</p>

<p>Recenlty I took a technically test and I have write an employee class for an aspx page that will <br/>
use an abstract class that implements an Interface.</p>

<p>What is abstract class ?<br/>
Abstract class is a base class or a parent class. Abstract classes can have empty abstract methods <br/>
or it can have implemented methods which can be overridden by child classes.</p>

<p>What are interfaces?<br/>
Interface is a contract class with empty methods, properties and functions. <br/>
Any class which implements the interface has to compulsory implement all the <br/>
empty methods, functions and properties of the interface.</p>

<p><code>
Interface</p>

<p>using System;<br/>
using System.Collections.Generic;<br/>
using System.Linq;<br/>
using System.Web;</p>

<p>namespace Employee.Interface<br/>
{<br/>
   public interface IEmployee<br/>
   {</p>

<pre><code>    String Name  
    {  
        get;  
        set;  
    }  

    String DateJoin  
    {  
        get;  
        set;  
    }  

   String Department  
   {  
       get;  
       set;  
   }  

   bool Save(String mName, String mDate, String mDepartment);  
</code></pre>

<p>   }<br/>
}</p>

<p>Abstract Class</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I been suffering form lower back pain for last 2 weeks which has disturbed my training schedule. I been having back problem for many years but it has been getting pretty bad for the past 2 years. It seems lack of strength training on the lower back is causing my muscles to tense up when it&#8217;s overuse. The tense up muscle affects the nerves near the spine area which cause a shooting pain to the lower butt and leg area. The only thing I can do is to get physiotherapy now and slowly strengthen my back before pounding on the training load.</p>

The latest addition is Skype.<br/>

<ol>
<li><p>Install Skype on your PC and then find the installation folder. It&#8217;s probably something like &#8220;C:Program FilesSkype.&#8221; Copy the Skype.exe file to a folder on your USB flash drive.  </p></li>
<li><p>In that same folder on your flash drive, create a subfolder called &#8220;data.&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>Create a new text file called &#8220;Skype.bat&#8221; or Skype Portable.bat&#8221; or whatever you like.</p></li>
