    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://adsense.blogspot.com/2007/12/farewell-onsite-advertiser-sign-up.html">Google</a> will be removing the Onsite Advertiser Sign-up feature.</p>

<p><em>Ã¢â‚¬Å“Our recent findings indicate that the Onsite Advertiser Sign-up feature, which allowed advertisers to sign up for AdWords campaigns on your site, hasn't been performing as well as we had hoped. We've elected to gracefully retire this feature and focus our efforts on developing and supporting features that drive better monetization results for you. Call it time management, call it ROI, call it our unwavering commitment to our publishers. We want you to earn more revenue, and sometimes that means "sunsetting" certain features we created.Ã¢â‚¬ </em></p>

<p>Any links you've created that lead to a customizable Onsite Advertiser Sign-up page will be re-direct to the main AdWords sign-up page.</p>
