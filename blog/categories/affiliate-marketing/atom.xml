    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Building a landing page can be very confusing. I have studied many landing page website recently, and found that these model works really well.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use attractive pictures to attract more users to research the title.</p></li>
<li><p>Analysis of potential customers pain and problems with the current services or product.</p></li>
<li><p>sell the benefits of product or service not the features.</p></li>
<li><p>Using a large number testimonials.</p></li>
<li><p>Money back guarantee.</p></li>
<li><p>Give additional benefits for customers who make immediately purchase.</p></li>
<li><p>Build an opt-in list, its takes 7 follow up to make a sale.</p></li>
</ol>

Now, when you use the Keyword Tool to search for relevant keywords to include in your keyword list, you'll be able to see the approximate number of search queries matching your keywords that were performed on Google and the search network, instead of the graphic bar.</p>
