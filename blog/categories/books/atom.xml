    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recent read a book which mention that if a person spent enough time reading the right book, it could transform the person's life and change it forever. The concept is known as <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/wizcoder-20">Life Transforming Resources</a>. I start reading self improvement books since 2003, My life is definitely not the same each time I implement a part of what I read. Books like The magic of thinking big and Win friends and influence people are books that you can reread each year. My favorite one is Think and grow rich. I was once told that Anthony Robins read this book a 100 times to get to where he is today. I hope this <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/wizcoder-20">Life Transforming Resources</a> would benefit you.</p>
