    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I seem to lost a few days post from all my blogs. Some post are really good and I don't have a backup. It must been ease when the support staffs are rolling the backups. Well looks like I need to put some really good contents back. Since I can't do it as I will be away for most of the time, I figure a blog contest is the best way to bring in the guest post. Ok the 4 125x125 ads space is up for grads again in March.</p>

<p>The contest is simply, just <a href="mailto:admin@wizcodersolution.com">email</a> your post to me and the highest hit post wins. The winner gets the 125x125 ads space on my sidebar for the entire month of March. Your post must be 250 words long and you may include 1 links to your website. Blog post can be of any topic, as long as its not adult. Did I miss anything?</p>
