    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are a few articles on home office in the newspaper. Most of it revolve around creating a structure and being discipline. It felt like these people are creating a environment similar to a job except that you are at home. The main reason we set up home office are because we want freedom, work when we please, and we feel like it. Creating a structure? If i need structure and discipline I would get a job or get a real office.</p>

<p><strong>Furnishing your home office.</strong>
If you are starting out, I would minimize and improvise on furniture. If you Spend $3000 on new equipment, it will eat into your profit, advertisings or marketing cost. I would get better equipment when my business picks up, and add more on the way. That way I spending what I can afford.</p>

<p><strong>Meeting client</strong>
It would be easier to meet the client at their place, rather than have it the other way around. at the same time allows you to get some fresh air.</p>

<p>What matter most is "<strong>Its your rules!</strong>".</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://a2.vox.com/6a00cd9719d53d4cd500d4142583ea6a47-150wi" alt="" />#32 is different from others because he is a programmer. He is Pierre Omidyar, born on June 21, 1967, a French-Iranian-American entrepreneur and philanthropist/economist. If you have not heard of him you may know him as the founder/chairman of the eBay.</p>

<p>Pierre Omidyar was born in Paris, France. He moved to Maryland with his family when his physician father began his residency at Johns Hopkins University Medical Center. Pierre developed an interest in computing while still at St. Andrew's Episcopal School (Maryland) in Bethesda. He taught himself BASIC on a TRS-80. In 1988 he graduated in computer science from Tufts University, and joined Claris, an Apple Computer subsidiary. In 1991, he co-founded Ink Development Corp. with three friends. The company included an Internet shopping segment and was later renamed eShop Inc. Omidyar worked as a software engineer for eShop until the end of 1994, when he became a developer services engineer for General Magic, a mobile communication platform company. In 1996, eShop was sold to Microsoft, but Omidyar remained fascinated by the technical challenges of online commerce.</p>

<p>Omidyar was intrigued by the technical problem of establishing an online venue for direct person-to-person auction of collectible items. Omidyar was 28 when he sat down over a long holiday weekend to write the original computer code for eBay. He created a simple prototype on his personal web page, and launched Auction Web as a sole proprietorship on Labor Day weekend in 1995. Auction Web was later renamed "eBay", after Echo Bay, Omidyar's consulting firm, when "echobay.com" was unavailable. The service was free at first, but started charging in order to cover Internet service provider costs. Pierre turned eBay into the most successful company of the dotcom era. In September 1998, eBay launched a successful public offering, make Omidyar a billionaire.</p>

<p>From a keynote speech at Tufts University:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>"So people often say to me - "when you built the system, you must have known that making it self-sustainable was the only way eBay could grow to serve 40 million users a day." Well... nope. I made the system self-sustaining for one reason: Back when I launched eBay on Labor Day 1995, eBay wasn't my business - it was my hobby. I had to build a system that was self-sustaining... because I had a real job to go to every morning.</em></p></blockquote>

<p><em>I was working as a software engineer from 10 to 7, and I wanted to have a life on the weekends. So I built a system that could keep working - catching complaints and capturing feedback -- even when Pam and I were out mountain-biking, and the only one home was our cat."</em></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How do you develop a domain? Do you research a niche first, purchase the domain to developed the site or purchase a couple of domain and try to develop them in their niches? Which is the better way? For a internet marketer, niches research is vital, revenue and demand for that particular product or services is crucial to the success of the website. However, for a developer, we look at mass production, cheap domain, fast manufacturing and a quick sale. I personal approach is to scout the market for demand of certain type of websites and develop a bunch of them and sell off cheap. This way I made some quick cash and repeat the process again. Its a lot like real estate development. Sometimes, I develop a site further by adding unique content, getting backlinks, drive traffic and improve its pr. It really depends on the domain I have purchase. I notice a current trend in eBay stores sites, theres a huge increase for demand in eBay affiliate sites. You may want to look into that for your next development.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wikipedia describe entrepreneur as An entrepreneur is a person who operates a new enterprise or venture and assumes some accountability for the inherent risks. If you have line up all the successful entrepreneur in the world and tried to profile them, you find that they all different. From the size, looks, to the way they think and operate. There are no fixed rule to become an entrepreneur, but at some point you be required to take risks or perform and work in a way that most peers will not. If you go back to all the successful entrepreneurs and ask them for the key to their success, you probably get as many as the number of people you asked. How do become successful? We do it by failing more than others and we get up each time. Technical skills like marketing, writing business plan, managing can be learn but attitude and commitment are forged through countless hardship, visualization, developing passion and undying attitude. What the most important thing you can do to be a successful entrepreneur is simply "Don't Quit"</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I define entrepreneur as someone who have control over their own future. Every entrepreneur is different. Each has their own set of strengths, weaknesses, talents and abilities. However, entrepreneurs who have stood the test of time and have made a difference do share common characteristics. What words do you associate with an entrepreneur? Passion, vision, leadership, commitment?</p>

<p>What are the three key characteristics of an entrepreneur?
1.<strong>Vision</strong>
Entrepreneurs provides a sense of direction by being the light at the end of the tunnel. Their the guiding stars when everyone else are lost. Vision helps the entrepreneur to define their goals. Vision is used to clearly communicated the goals to the stakeholders and must motivate them. To be successful the entrepreneur first needs to understand why these stakeholders will find the vision appealing and benefits them. Once the vision is in place the entrepreneur can start work on the business plan.</p>

<p>2.<strong>High risk-taker</strong>
Entrepreneurs are constantly moving and exploring uncharted waters, redefining, improving certain traits that often treated as risk by conventional business owner. Entrepreneurs understands the need for breakthroughs and in order to break new grounds, calculated risk must be taken. More often the higher the risk, the higher the rewards or failure. Entrepreneurs allow themselves to fail and learn form past experiences.</p>

<p>3.<strong>Hard work</strong>
A recent study show that the average number of hours put in from an entrepreneurs amount to 60 hours per week or more. However, I believe that's the minimum. An entrepreneurs is constantly working, their are loaded with issues and every minute is spent trying to solve a problem.</p>

<p>Entrepreneurs are individuals but we must not mistaken that entrepreneursÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ individual knowledge and skill is irrelevant to the success of a new venture. Entrepreneurs are just people who work hard to gain control over their own futures.</p>
