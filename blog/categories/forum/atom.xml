    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Promoting a forum is no different than promoting any other site. Quality link building, content, advertisements, etc. You need to get the word out to as many people as you can, and you need the forum to be optimized for the search engines. Try participating in other forums similar to your niche. Don't spam but rather participate constructively - you have better chances that your site gets noticed on your forum signature that way.</p>

<p>Attracting traffic to your site is easier than trying able to make those visitors register and participate. That would have to depend on how lively and useful the forum topics are in your forum. A simple way would be to invite friends, colleagues, family first into your forum to jump start the discussions. As conversations build up, a sense of community will also follow and your visitors will come back to your site almost religiously every day.
One of the ways to link building for forum is by submitting your forums to a list of good quality forum directories rather than general web directories. This directories are targeted at forum searchers. Here's a list of good directories I found.</p>

<p>http://www.forumshowcase.com/
http://www.forumzilla.com/add.php **don't list forums &lt;100 users
http://www.forumsinfo.com
http://www.foruma-z.com/addurl.php
http://www.bbswatch.com/index.shtml
http://www.bluenoserlinks.com/
http://www.findyourforum.com/
http://www.webmasters-central.com/
http://www.grandeforum.com/</p>

<p>Remember, you will not get a popular forum instantly... It involves hard work and patience.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Forums can be a great way to create more profit for your business. The big forums can make a fortune but unless you can generate 1,000s of visitors a day forget it. One of the key factors for profitable forums is getting people to sign up. If you have no visitors or members, your forum will never grow. You need people in your forum and you need them to be talking about things that will get others to join in. You need make things interesting and create topics that people are interested in. Nonone will join an empty forums. You need to invest time to make your forum look professional.</p>

<p>Make it Easy to Join
First make the registration process as easy as possible. Just ask for username, name and email address for a start. Make it in a way members can fill out their full profile at a later date.</p>

<p>Get Subscribers Early
DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wait for opening day to get people to sign up for your forum. You can get friends and current customers to post early and help you test it; then, when people come to your forum for the first time, it will already appear active.</p>

<p>Promoting your forum on other forum
Other related forum can be a good place to promote your forum but be careful to not to look as thought you are snatching their members. Add a link to it in your signature where the forum users there can also offer their opinions at your.</p>

<p>Make active members moderators
Once your have a pool of active users, look for the most active one make them moderators. This will make them feel like they are part of your forum community and take the work of moderating for spam of your hand.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most people understand the basics of SEO and generating traffic. You need good content that people are looking for and keep the contents updated. Many SEO followers would start a blog because of this reason however generating content is never easy, a blog post needs to be a mnum of 200 words to be of any effects. One of the easiest way to do generate content without your own effort is to start a forum,  where subscribers create the content for you instead. I am sure that everyone knows about the value of having a forum. A forum is a community of a particular chosen niche that helps to generate revenue, rank higher on search engines. With lots of information and discussion being exchanged in your forums visitors will return again and again to see replies to their posts, read others posts and basically to see if anything has changed or if opinions have swayed to their side. A forum can be a place for people to discuss issues, share knowledge and generate relationships.</p>

<p>The very first thing to do is to decide a niche topic for your forum. I suggest you only consider starting a forum site about something that you have a strong interest in yourself. There are a surprising number of headaches running a forum. Even with the income I wouldn't do it if I did not enjoy the topic. A hot tip on creating a good forum is to start a forum in a smaller niche where few quality boards exist. This will attract your core audience to discuss about a certain topic of interest. Do not add too many sub forums and keep all sub topics related to the your niche.</p>

<p>When starting up the first technical thing to consider is the platform for the forum. There are so many forum scripts you can choose from. Normally I prefer free forum scripts in php like phpBB3 which can ran on both windows and linux and they are provided by most web hosting companies. I would suggest you to start off with a free forum script, you can always migrate to other softwares later. Next, you need a reliable host for your forum, you can start off with basic package that cost around $4 a month and upgrade it when your forum grows. Now that you have everything setup, you just need to get visitors to join as a member.</p>
