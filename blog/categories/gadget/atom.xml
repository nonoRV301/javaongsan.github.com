    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Finally...we get Kindle ship to us outside of US. Amazon introduces a new addition to the Kindle family of wireless reading devices: <strong>Kindle with U.S. and International Wireless</strong>. With this new Kindle, you can receive your books, newspapers, and magazines wirelessly while at home or abroad in over 100 countries. Whether you're in New York, Paris, SÃ£o Paulo, Mumbai, Beijing, Tokyo, or Sydney, you can think of a book and be reading it in less than 60 seconds. The $279 Kindle with U.S. and International Wireless can be preordered today for delivery starting in two weeks.</p>

<p>Kindle utilizes the same 3G wireless technology as advanced cell phones, so you never need to hunt for a Wi-Fi hotspot. Unlike cell phones, there are no monthly wireless bills and no yearly contracts. There is no software to install, and no syncing required.</p>

<p>The 8" x 5.3" x 0.36" Kindle is as thin as most magazines and weighs less than a paperbackâ€”but can hold 1,500 books. Its electronic-ink screen looks and reads like real paper with no glareâ€”even in bright sunlight. A long battery life means you can read for up to two weeks on a single charge.</p>

<p>You can order one <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00154JDAI?tag=YOUR_ID_HERE-20%20and%20http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015T963C?tag=wizcoder-20"> here</a></p>
