    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I seen a few ysm $100 vouchers been hand around. I only have a link to a <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-2613438-10457500">$25 credit voucher</a>. I found a promo code for $100 voucher "US2334". I follow the $25 link which gave me the url "<a href="http://sem.smallbusiness.yahoo.com/searchenginemarketing/onlinemarketing.php?o=USCJ21&amp;cmp=Affiliate&amp;ctv=CJ&amp;s=A&amp;s2=&amp;s3&amp;AID=10457500&amp;PID=2613438&amp;abr=2022416117">http://sem.smallbusiness.yahoo.com/searchenginemarketing/onlinemarketing.php?o=USCJ21&amp;cmp=Affiliate&amp;ctv=CJ&amp;s=A&amp;s2=&amp;s3&amp;AID=10457500&amp;PID=2613438&amp;abr=2022416117</a>"
I replace the promo code to give me "<a href="http://sem.smallbusiness.yahoo.com/searchenginemarketing/onlinemarketing.php?o=US2334&amp;cmp=Affiliate&amp;ctv=CJ&amp;s=A&amp;s2=&amp;s3&amp;AID=10457500&amp;PID=2613438&amp;abr=2022416117">http://sem.smallbusiness.yahoo.com/searchenginemarketing/onlinemarketing.php?o=US2334&amp;cmp=Affiliate&amp;ctv=CJ&amp;s=A&amp;s2=&amp;s3&amp;AID=10457500&amp;PID=2613438&amp;abr=2022416117</a>" It worked now I have a $100 voucher, but in order to get the $100 free credit, you need to deposit $30 by credit card or a verified paypal account.</p>

    <id>http://javaongsan.github.com/blog/2008/03/10/how-to-increase-link-sales-and-paid-post-pricing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most average blogger will scout around paid-post or link sales networks and pick up scrapes. $5 for a blog post or $3 for a link on your blog. Have you wonder how other blog get $100 dollars or more for a link or paid post? Are you pasting link all over your blog and not making enough for a decent meal at Macdonald's?</p>

<p>I got few pointers for you guys if you are looking to improve your pricing.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Set a monthly target on how much you need.
You need to know how much you need so you know when to stop. Set a reasonable target. If your link is price at$5 don't set a target of $1000 link sales. A more appropriates target is $50.</p></li>
<li><p>Use common sense quality control.
Accept only relevant advertisements to your sites. This makes the links more acceptable to  your users and increase click through which result in returning customer.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not sell more than a month.
A very common mistake that I see regularly is selling permanent links. Its like having a scare on your face. This will only limit your income potential.</p></li>
<li><p>PR and traffic is important too.
Link price are pretty much tie to traffic and PR so make sure you spent enough time on both of them. As your traffic and PR increases you can adjust your price accordingly but when they drop do not drop your link price. If you do, you are back to square 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't depend on Advertiser networks to sell your links, ad space or paid post. Email site owners, go to forum, do whatever it takes to make the sales. You are the sales director of your blog, you are in charge of selling, don't wait for someone else to do it for you.</p></li>
</ol>
