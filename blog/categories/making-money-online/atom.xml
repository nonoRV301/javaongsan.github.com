    <id>http://javaongsan.github.com/blog/2008/02/01/january-2008-income-report</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's the start of a new month and that means it's time for do our income report. I been making money from blogging and other online marketing methods since May 2007. I always treat it as a game, trying to break new high score every month. I have made from varies source (see my <a href="http://javaongsan.github.com/2007/11/10/money-maker-2/">money makers</a>) but I did not manage to keep a steady source which look more like a hit and run.</p>

<p>During the new year I made decision to break the $300 mark and achieve $500 per month, and double it each month after. Keep in mind I have accumulated 14 sites now. So how did I do for January.</p>

<p><strong>Total Blog Income For January 2008: $</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://javaongsan.reseller.hop.clickbank.net/">clickbank</a></p>

<p>$17.98</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sponsoredreviews.com/?aid=2496">sponsoredreviews.com</a></p>

<p>45.5</p>

<p><a href="http://www.smorty.com/?B=3186">Smorty.com</a></p>

<p>6</p>

<p><a href="http://www.blogsvertise.com/?rid=b3260">Blogsvertise </a></p>

<p>31</p>

<p>Adsense</p>

<p>10</p>

<p><strong>Total </strong></p>

<p><strong>$110.48</strong></p>

<p>Despite making an effort to increase my earning from blogs and Adsense sites, I neglected the more profitable ebook sale sites. Although Adsense earning decline, I been getting pretty good ads on my blogs. One of my recurring problem is that my VPS tend to crash from time to time. I have figure out the problem yet.</p>

<p>Advertising expenses for the month was $0.2 and VPS Hosting $44.5. I also purchased $144.85 worth of domains. So this is not a profitable month. For next month, I will double the earning of this month.</p>

    <id>http://javaongsan.github.com/blog/2008/01/25/how-to-make-100-a-day</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Quick and dirty way to make $100 a day.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use <a href="http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-2613438-10405191">Go Daddy Bulk Domain Registration</a><img src="http://www.ftjcfx.com/image-2613438-10405191" alt="" /> and grad 100 domains.</p></li>
<li><p>Get a host, VPS prefer, from <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-2613438-10378494">GoDaddy.com Hosting Plans</a><img src="http://www.ftjcfx.com/image-2613438-10378494" alt="" /> or somewhere better.</p></li>
<li><p>Download install wordpress with plugging like adsense-deluxe.php, google-sitemap-generator, and feedwordpress on all 100 domains.</p></li>
<li><p>Setup rss feeds with feedwordpress. I prefer to use technorati search.</p></li>
<li><p>Slap on Adsense.</p></li>
<li><p>Submit sitemap to Google webmaster central.</p></li>
<li><p>Go Live</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Almost immediate, you start getting organic traffic from search engines. Adsense earning will start going up eventually will float around $1 after a week for each domain. For 100 domains, you make $100 a day. Its get more stable after a month and die off after that. Before that you could get 1 or 2 months of good organic traffic with almost 1000 uniques a day on 1 technorati tags.</p>

<p>If we work it out.</p>

<p>$1 x 100 (domains) x 60 (2 months) = $6000 - $700 (domain cost) - $50 (hosting) = $5 250.</p>

<p>Of course there several , downside to this techniques beside ethical issues. The original content owner will be unhappy and threaten you to remove their content. You also have a bandwidth issue, if you hosting bandwidth is too small, you site crash frequently. You also have redesign these 100 domains after they loose steam. Sometimes a website can die prematurely after a few days if you are not well verse in SEO.</p>

    <updated>2008-01-17T03:27:45+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://javaongsan.github.com/blog/2008/01/17/how-to-launch-a-forum</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are some good old post that offers great ideas on how to launch a  forum.</p>

<p>Ahmed Bilal offers some tips with this post <a href="http://performancing.com/how-to-launch-a-forum-on-your-blog">How to launch a forum on your blog</a>
_ # I hope you have friends as bloggers in your niche - leverage relationships to help give exposure to your forum through other blogs (note, you might want to offer an incentive - an offer for their readers, perhaps). It pays to make friends though._</p>

<p><em># Create linkbait in advance and publish them on the day the forum launches - then use the resulting attention and traffic and funnel it to the forum. It's cheap, and requires some effort, but matched with your existing blogging community this tactic alone can give your forum the initial push it needs to survive.</em></p>

<p><em># Pre-populate the forum with some posts and threads so that it's not totally empty. One tactic is to email regular readers and co-bloggers and get them to 'start' on the forum a day or two before the actual launch. Real posts are always better than you creating 10 different IDs and posting under them.</em></p>

<p><em># Building up interest in the forum in advance is a no-brainer, but instead of putting up announcements about it run a competition and give out a prize, make the competition winnable only through the forum and then promote that prize / competition everywhere. It's been done before, but it works.</em></p>

<p><em># Got some spare cash? Pay a popular blog to cover your forum - find a proper angle to suit that blogger's audience if necessary.</em></p>

<p>Yaro Starak offers his advice on <a href="http://www.entrepreneurs-journey.com/568/how-to-launch-a-forum-with-an-instant-audience/">How To Launch A Forum With An Instant Audience</a>
_ "HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a strategy for launching a buzzing forum from day one - create an uber-popular blog first, then launch a forum and bring your existing blog audience over to it._</p>

<p><em>Steve Pavlina has done just that launching his brand new Personal Development for Smart People Forums. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s already reported explosive traffic growth at the forums and as I type this there are over 270 people on the forum with registrations numbers over 1000 and I expect the growth wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be stopping any time soon."</em></p>

<p>Other good launch idea are to offer discounts and prizes for those who post the most during a certain time. Rewards often attracts attention and creates buzz. I have seen forums offering some cash gift for people with highest posts every week and they do work well. It works very well and really does get the posting going.</p>

    <id>http://javaongsan.github.com/blog/2007/12/24/techniques-to-promote-your-business-on-myspace-5</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a series of post on how to use the popular website, MySpace to promote your business and make more money.
<a href="http://javaongsan.github.com/2007/12/16/techniques-to-promote-your-business-on-myspace/">Techniques to promote your business on MySpace</a>
<a href="http://javaongsan.github.com/2007/12/17/techniques-to-promote-your-business-on-myspace-2/">Techniques to promote your business on MySpace #2</a>

<a href="http://javaongsan.github.com/2007/12/17/techniques-to-promote-your-business-on-myspace-4/">Techniques to promote your business on MySpace #4</a></p>

<p>Now we want to get in touch we our new found friends. As many of you would have found out that most MySpace users accepts your friend invitation but did not visit your profile therefore they would never be able to join your list. Our strategy are based on getting friends, friends join your list, you provide the information they need by your website, after a few follow up some of them will buy. Getting friends on your lists is the next most crucial art after adding friends. By now you should have opt-in form on your profile. If not, you can create an opt-in form with autoresponder like  <a href="http://javaongsan.github.com/recommends/aweber/">aweber</a>.</p>

<p>To get your friends to visit your page you can opt to contact them by private messaging or by bulletin. Form my experience, bulletin gets spam quickly, you not only seeing posting from friends in your network but friends in your friends network. Messaging a hundred of your friends might seem a bit tedious but you can make use of software like <a href="http://www.addnewfriends.com/affiliate/idevaffiliate.php?id=1372">Friend Blaster Pro</a>  to speed up the process. Next we make use of bulletin to get to your extended networks which means we are reaching out to your friend's network.
Make you bulletin message interesting so your extend network will be dawn to your profile. Because bulletin get replace quickly, you can use software to post the same message every hour. Since not all the user are logon at the same time, they will unlikely to see your message if its posted once.</p>

<p>Next we look at a useful tool in MySpace and thats the blog. MySpace behaves like any other blogs, they allow easy blog set up and posting. Html are accepted but not javascript. Comments from other MySpace users are allowed but these can be set to comments from your own network. Using blogs to interest them and using links in your blogs to get them to your webpage is very important. I used a excerpt of my main blog for my space blog. In the end of the post its reads "to read the full posts go here...". Therefore I am driving traffic to my product blog. At the same time I only allow comments from my friends network forcing other users to add me as their friends in order for them to comment. This is to prevent other marketers from posting their products in the comments, or using comments to drive traffic away. We can also profit from MySpace blog by selling ads space, textlink ads or html ads. You can also make money by applying to paid to blog services like <a href="http://www.smorty.com/?B=3186">Smorty</a>, <a href="http://tinyurl.com/23pnjg">Payperpost</a>, <a href="http://www.sponsoredreviews.com/?aid=2496">Sponsoredreviews</a>, <a href="http://bdv.bidvertiser.com/bidvertiser/referral_button.html?pid=57114">BidVertiser</a>. This little incomes will pay for all those software we are buying and once your marketing take off and you are profiting from your sales of your product, you can opt to stop doing it. Blogs are also highly visible to search engines. That means if you make a new entry on your blog here on MySpace, and you can see how very easy it is to do, it becomes an indexable page on Google and the other big search engines almost immediately. That means you can utilize your knowledge of keyword selection and leverage the blog to get a stronger marketing position on search engines.</p>
