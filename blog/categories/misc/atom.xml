    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometime ago yahoo search marking was merge into mircosoft adcenter. Recently I receive a refund for one of my inactive account, totalling about $200 but it was issue to the account name created and not to my real name. Therefor I couldn't cash the cheque. I log in to my account again trying find a email contact to ask to have the cheque reissue but all contact was remove except for a hotline number. I google and found the FAQ page which gave instructions on how to get my check reissue. http://advertisingcentral.yahoo.com/refund</p>
