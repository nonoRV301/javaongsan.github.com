    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.online-tech-tips.com/computer-tips/how-to-change-mac-address/">online-tech-tips.com</a> post a very useful tip on how to change your mac-address. Yes, I too taught it not possile to change a pc's mac address. Definitely a useful trick.</p>

<p>Step 1: Click on  <strong>Start</strong>, then  <strong>Control Panel</strong>, then  <strong>Network Connections</strong>, and right-click on the network connection you want to change the MAC address for and select<strong>Properties</strong>. It will normally either be  <strong>Local Area Connection</strong>  or  <strong>Wireless Network Connection</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.online-tech-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/localareaconnection.png"><img src="http://www.online-tech-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/localareaconnection-thumb.png" alt="local area connection" /></a></p>

<p>If you are using Windows Vista, you have to go to  <strong>Control Panel,</strong>  then  <strong>Network and Internet,</strong>  then  <strong>Network and Sharing Center,</strong>  and then  <strong>Manage Network Connections</strong>.</p>

<p>Step 2: On the  <strong>General</strong>  tab, click the  <strong>Configure</strong>  button</p>

<p><a href="http://www.online-tech-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/configurenetwork.png"><img src="http://www.online-tech-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/configurenetwork-thumb.png" alt="configure network" /></a></p>

<p>Step 3: Now click on the Advanced tab and click on the â€œ<strong>Locally Administered Address</strong>â€ property or the â€œ<strong>Network Address</strong>â€ property.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.online-tech-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/locallyadministeredaddress.png"><img src="http://www.online-tech-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/locallyadministeredaddress-thumb.png" alt="locally administered address" /></a></p>

<p>By default, the â€œNot Presentâ€ value is selected. Go ahead and click on the  <strong>Value</strong>radio button and enter in a new MAC address. The MAC address is a combination of 6 pairs of numbers and characters, i.e. 40-A2-D9-82-9F-F2. You should enter the MAC address without the dashes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.online-tech-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/newmacaddress.png"><img src="http://www.online-tech-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/newmacaddress-thumb.png" alt="new mac address" /></a></p>

<p>You can check that the MAC address has been changed by going to the command prompt and typing in  <strong>IPCONFIG /ALL</strong>. Go ahead and restart the computer in order for the changes to take effect.</p>
