    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are using WordPress 2.3.2 and have registration enabled, pay attention. A flaw was found in the XML-RPC implementation such that a specially crafted request would allow a user to edit posts of other users on that blog. 2.3.3 also fixes <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;milestone=2.3.3">a few minor bugs</a>.  If you are interested only in the security fix, download the <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/2.3.3/xmlrpc.php?format=raw">fixed version of <code>xmlrpc.php</code></a> and copy it over your existing <code>xmlrpc.php</code>.  Otherwise, you can get the entire release <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Also, there is <a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/01/21/wp-forum-plugin-security-bulletin/">a vulnerability in the WP-Forum plugin</a> that is being actively exploited right now. If you are using this plugin, please remove it until an update is available from its author.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The once popluar Netscape Communicator is coming to an end. After February 1, 2008 there will be no more active product support for Navigator 9, or any previous Netscape Navigator browser. This includes Netscape v1-v4.x, Netscape v6, Netscape v7 Suite, Netscape Browser v8, and Netscape Navigator/Messenger 9.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.netscape.com/2007/12/28/end-of-support-for-netscape-web-browsers">netscape</a>: <em>"AOL's focus on transitioning to an ad-supported web business leaves little room for the size of investment needed to get the Netscape browser to a point many of its fans expect it to be. Given AOL's current business focus and the success the Mozilla Foundation has had in developing critically-acclaimed products, we feel it's the right time to end development of Netscape branded browsers, hand the reins fully to Mozilla and encourage Netscape users to adopt Firefox."</em></p>
