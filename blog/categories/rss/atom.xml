    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The actual question is What are your criteria for subscribing to a particular RSS feed? Feed count, popularity or simply because you like it? What ever your reason, you shouldn't have a criteria. In fact, my suggestion is to subscribe to any blog you came across. like anyone else I don't like to help a blog increased their feed count or readership by subscribing to them, especially when there are only 1 digit. I do not subscribe to any blog who I am not found of, or if I think they are boring, or for whatever reason. Since reading a post y John Chow about his idea of tracking a numerous blogs for ideas, I started to wonder. Could I be missing out on some valuable informations by refusing to subscribe to a blog? I think the answer is obvious. Now that I amÃ‚   writingÃ‚   more blog, I need more informations,Ã‚   someÃ‚   in specific niche, I found that its really useful to read more blogs. Not only does it generate new ideas for content, some of them have good writing styles which I can follow. I may also be tracking blogs that are starting out and testing certain techniques on blogging or affiliate marketing. There a lot of things that I learn through other people's experiences.</p>

<p>Many will argue the time I wasted tracking so many feeds, well I not going for PHD here so I don't study every single content in details, I simple do a quick scan of all the titles and pick out a few that I will go through. You may also used different readers, or create different foldersÃ‚   to separate the feeds. A golden rule that I live by now "Only Subscribe, Do Not Unsubscribe!".</p>
