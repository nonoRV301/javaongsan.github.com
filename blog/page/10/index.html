  <div class="entry-content"><p>To be an online business entrepreneur, one of the easiest ways to get started is with affiliate marketing. Affiliate marketing is to sell other peoples products and services and receive money. As an affiliate marketer, you sell either an advertiser&#8217;s product. You sign up with the company, are given a text link and usually nowadays, a host of graphics, banners and articles that relate to the company/product and you then have to promote it.</p>

<p>Affiliate marketing is one of the best income opportunities for several reason:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You Don&#8217;t Need Your Own Product</p></li>
<li><p>You don&#8217;t need to spend time creating a technically beautiful website</p></li>
<li><p>You don&#8217;t need to spend big bucks on great sales copy</p></li>
<li><p>You don&#8217;t need employees, or inventory, or any of the things that make a &#8220;business&#8221; a pain in the neck.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Does sound easy doesn&#8217;t it? Still many have fail, why? Affiliate marketing market is dynamic and constantly evolving. You need to keep pace to profits. The basics of affiliate marketing are Profitable Market, Products, Landing Page, Massive Traffic but these is only the basics. I have been studying successful marketers, most of them took an average of 6 months to figure out a successful campaign, they promote a minimum of 5 products in different niche, they spent up to $300 in pay-per-click search engine, they wrote tons of articles. One of the best affiliate marketers tutorial I have come across is Ewen Chia&#8217;s Autopilot Profits.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.squidoo.com/resize.php?1178870188&amp;filename=draft_lens1358693module2163138photo_big-bundle-small.jpg" alt="" />Ewen Chia&#8217;s Autopilot Profits really is a step by step, blue print for affiliate marketing and earning money online. If you are starting out this tutorial for you. Aim at internet marketing newbies Autopilot Profits consists of 6 video tutorials which can be watched online or downloaded, an Autopilot Profits eBook in PDF format, an Advertising eBook in PDF format and keywords / keyword phrases for use in your PPC campaigns.</p>

<p>The video titles are:<br/>
1 - Autopilot Profits: Is It Really Doable?<br/>
2 - Finding The Hungry Crowd<br/>
3 - Feeding The Hungry<br/>
4a - Marketing Your Product: Site Setup And Redirects<br/>
4b - Marketing Your Product: Fast Traffic Techniques<br/>
4c - Marketing Your Product: Long-Term Traffic Techniques<br/>
5 - Putting It All On Autopilot<br/>
6 - How to Set Up Your Own Instant Turnkey Profit-Printing Money Machine Now</p>

<p>I found the videos and chapters to be laid out logically with each one building on the information covered in the previous chapter. Obviously the video tutorials should be watched in order and in conjunction with reading the relevant chapter in the Autopilot Profits book. If you download the videos you can always review them any time a question arises about a particular topic covered in the Autopilot Profits tutorial.<br/>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I been ask by many people who are curious about or wanted to try to do a triathlon race &#8220;What are the necessary equipment they need?&#8221;. I no expert in Tri but I do not recommend getting expensive equipment for starter. Who knows when you will quit and what will become of your equipment? For your first race, its to get a feel of what its like and whether you want to continue to pursue this. After each tri event, I see first timer selling off their brand new equipment at lower prize and quiting the sport.</p>

<p>What do you really need?<br/>
Swim<br/>
Goggles<br/>
Swim trunks / suit - no need to invest in a tri suit<br/>
swim cap are provided by organisers</p>

<p>Bike<br/>
Helmet<br/>
Bike, mountain bike, market bike, bmx are all allowed but they must be 2 wheels, no training wheels. You may rent a bike.<br/>
Shoes, this can be any normal shoes<br/>
Water bottle<br/>

<p>Run<br/>
Socks (optional)<br/>
Running shoes<br/>
Cap (optional)<br/>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wikipedia describe entrepreneur as An entrepreneur is a person who operates a new enterprise or venture and assumes some accountability for the inherent risks. If you have line up all the successful entrepreneur in the world and tried to profile them, you find that they all different. From the size, looks, to the way they think and operate. There are no fixed rule to become an entrepreneur, but at some point you be required to take risks or perform and work in a way that most peers will not. If you go back to all the successful entrepreneurs and ask them for the key to their success, you probably get as many as the number of people you asked. How do become successful? We do it by failing more than others and we get up each time. Technical skills like marketing, writing business plan, managing can be learn but attitude and commitment are forged through countless hardship, visualization, developing passion and undying attitude. What the most important thing you can do to be a successful entrepreneur is simply &#8220;Don&#8217;t Quit&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I seem to lost a few days post from all my blogs. Some post are really good and I don&#8217;t have a backup. It must been ease when the support staffs are rolling the backups. Well looks like I need to put some really good contents back. Since I can&#8217;t do it as I will be away for most of the time, I figure a blog contest is the best way to bring in the guest post. Ok the 4 125x125 ads space is up for grads again in March.</p>

<p>The contest is simply, just <a href="mailto:admin@wizcodersolution.com">email</a> your post to me and the highest hit post wins. The winner gets the 125x125 ads space on my sidebar for the entire month of March. Your post must be 250 words long and you may include 1 links to your website. Blog post can be of any topic, as long as its not adult. Did I miss anything?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The problem most people face when starting a weight lose workout is consistency. Most people set unrealistic goals and when they don&#8217;t reach them, it&#8217;s an excuse to give up. New research out of the University of California at Berkeley of more than 20,000 runners found that the people who quit on or took &#8220;breaks&#8221; from their fitness plans put on abnormal amounts of weight that they couldn&#8217;t easily knock off. So stick to your plan. No Excuses!</p>

<p>PUMP IT OUT<br/>
Weight training are the best fat basters and even cardio can&#8217;t match it. A research from Boston University shows that  muscles developed through strength and weight training, burn fat as readily as hours on an elliptical.</p>

<p>GET FIT IN JUST 3 WORKOUTS A WEEK<br/>
Nutrition is more important than your exercise habits. You are what you eat. Make sure you stick with whole, natural foods, such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, fish, and protein to set the foundation. For your exercise sessions, focus on quality and intensity, not quantity. Exercising 3 days a week for only 45 minutes or less. Strengthen your entire body with multi-muscle resistance exercises and burn fat by using short-burst interval training.  Follow that up with stretches for tight muscle groups only.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I define entrepreneur as someone who have control over their own future. Every entrepreneur is different. Each has their own set of strengths, weaknesses, talents and abilities. However, entrepreneurs who have stood the test of time and have made a difference do share common characteristics. What words do you associate with an entrepreneur? Passion, vision, leadership, commitment?</p>

<p>What are the three key characteristics of an entrepreneur?<br/>
1.<strong>Vision</strong><br/>
Entrepreneurs provides a sense of direction by being the light at the end of the tunnel. Their the guiding stars when everyone else are lost. Vision helps the entrepreneur to define their goals. Vision is used to clearly communicated the goals to the stakeholders and must motivate them. To be successful the entrepreneur first needs to understand why these stakeholders will find the vision appealing and benefits them. Once the vision is in place the entrepreneur can start work on the business plan.</p>

<p>2.<strong>High risk-taker</strong><br/>
Entrepreneurs are constantly moving and exploring uncharted waters, redefining, improving certain traits that often treated as risk by conventional business owner. Entrepreneurs understands the need for breakthroughs and in order to break new grounds, calculated risk must be taken. More often the higher the risk, the higher the rewards or failure. Entrepreneurs allow themselves to fail and learn form past experiences.</p>

<p>3.<strong>Hard work</strong><br/>
A recent study show that the average number of hours put in from an entrepreneurs amount to 60 hours per week or more. However, I believe that&#8217;s the minimum. An entrepreneurs is constantly working, their are loaded with issues and every minute is spent trying to solve a problem.</p>

<p>Entrepreneurs are individuals but we must not mistaken that entrepreneursÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ individual knowledge and skill is irrelevant to the success of a new venture. Entrepreneurs are just people who work hard to gain control over their own futures.</p>

<p>Do you have the characteristics of an entrepreneur? Which characteristics do you have and how ell do you made use of it? Sent us your stories.</p>
