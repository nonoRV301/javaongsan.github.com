  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are lots of debate on the number of blog one should have. Most successful bloggers are likely to write only one blog and it seems like you only need one blog to be profitable. What happens when your blog did not take off? Maybe there are no readers, not enough traffic, or simply a bad niche? I do believe that if you work hard on one blog alone, you eventually get there, but what about when you have not make it yet. Your blog have too little traffic or readers to sell advertisement and your Adsense earning is only a few cents for entire month.</p>

<p>When I started, I started 5 blogs and only kept 2. Overtime I have started new blogs, keep some going and shutdown some. I was working on a full-time job back then, I still found time to work each blog daily. There are many benefits of starting multiple blogs. You have a sharper learning curve, you save time by experimenting different things on different blogs. After a period of time, you will shutdown the less preforming ones and work on the better performing ones. You choose to let this discarded blog float, where you might find some use for them in the future or use it to link to some of your websites, you might even be able to sell links or advertising spaces on them.</p>

<p>While most of my blog were started with free host, I have found that time and time again that if you host your own blog, you get better traffic fast. I have one blog lunch that will gain organic traffic the next day. Of course there a lot more SEO tactics involved but then again you can&#8217;t use them on free hosts like blogger.</p>

<p>I doÃ‚   recommend you start as many blogs as you can, even 1 a day is not too much. Start them on a good domain name. Pack them with contents,Ã‚   try to write as many post as possible till you run dry of content before your lunch. Always have a sitemap and submit them to the search engines. Always have some kind of tracking code like Google analytics where you are to track keywords and popular post. Once you get a couple of blog, you can make money by doing paid posts, selling links or ad space, or you can sell the entire blog.</p>

<p>Just in case you are wondering I run 7 blogs now. Its definitely more profitable than when I am running one.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Quick and dirty way to make $100 a day.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use <a href="http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-2613438-10405191">Go Daddy Bulk Domain Registration</a><img src="http://www.ftjcfx.com/image-2613438-10405191" alt="" /> and grad 100 domains.</p></li>
<li><p>Get a host, VPS prefer, from <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-2613438-10378494">GoDaddy.com Hosting Plans</a><img src="http://www.ftjcfx.com/image-2613438-10378494" alt="" /> or somewhere better.</p></li>
<li><p>Download install wordpress with plugging like adsense-deluxe.php, google-sitemap-generator, and feedwordpress on all 100 domains.</p></li>
<li><p>Setup rss feeds with feedwordpress. I prefer to use technorati search.</p></li>
<li><p>Slap on Adsense.</p></li>
<li><p>Submit sitemap to Google webmaster central.</p></li>
<li><p>Go Live</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Almost immediate, you start getting organic traffic from search engines. Adsense earning will start going up eventually will float around $1 after a week for each domain. For 100 domains, you make $100 a day. Its get more stable after a month and die off after that. Before that you could get 1 or 2 months of good organic traffic with almost 1000 uniques a day on 1 technorati tags.</p>

<p>If we work it out.</p>

<p>$1 x 100 (domains) x 60 (2 months) = $6000 - $700 (domain cost) - $50 (hosting) = $5 250.</p>

<p>Of course there several , downside to this techniques beside ethical issues. The original content owner will be unhappy and threaten you to remove their content. You also have a bandwidth issue, if you hosting bandwidth is too small, you site crash frequently. You also have redesign these 100 domains after they loose steam. Sometimes a website can die prematurely after a few days if you are not well verse in SEO.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every year, on Valentines Day I send flowers to my wife&#8217;s office, that a big for deal for the ladies. If you haven&#8217;t notice, pay attention when a bouquet arrives and how every single one of them get excited about it.  As a guy ordering and getting flowers is a nightmare, not to mention the treatment from those unfriendly shop assistances. I would normally place my order a week before on a website <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=108912&amp;u=193030&amp;m=7726&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=">www.Flora2000.com!</a>. I have using the website for a few years and they have always delivered. If you wondering what to get your ladies, I recommend sending a dozen roses, its the best gift I know of.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of my weakness is not able to ride strong. When it gets down to crunch time my legs felt like jelly. The only way I am going to improve this season is a giant leap through biking. Recently I have a strain near my groin area which has slowed down my running and swimming. Old man are starting to zoom pass me at my regular running route. I hope that this 12 week plan will put some power back into my legs.</p>

<p>Following is a 12-week schedule from <a href="http://www.triathletemag.com/Departments/Training/2007/Ride_with_more_muscle_this_season.htm">triathletemag.com</a> of neuromuscular-training workouts that are designed to:<br/>
1) increase your muscle-activation potential during cycling and then;<br/>
2) increase the endurance characteristics of your newly recruited fast-twitch fibers.</p>

<p>Be sure to warm up thoroughly before doing these high-intensity efforts and to cool down thoroughly afterwards. The 30-second hill sprints should be performed on the steepest hill you can find. The one-minute hill sprints may be done on a shallower hill and will be done at a slightly lower intensity. Just spin slowly for recovery. Every fourth week is a scaled-back recovery week to prevent overtraining. By the end of week 12 you’ll be ready to race—with more muscle than ever.</p>

<p>Week 1: 4 x 30-sec. hill sprints w/ 2-min. active recoveries<br/>
Week 2: 6 x 30-sec. hill sprints w/ 2-min. active recoveries<br/>
Week 3: 8 x 30-second hill sprints with 2-minute active recovery<br/>
Week 4: (Recovery) 6 x 30-second hill sprints with 2-minute active recovery<br/>
Week 5: 6 x 1-minute hill sprints with 2-minute active recovery<br/>
Week 6: 8 x 1-minute hill sprints with 2-minute active recovery<br/>
Week 7: 10 x 1-minute hill sprints with 2-minute active recovery<br/>
Week 8: (Recovery) 6 x 1-minute hill sprints with 2-minute active recovery<br/>
Week 9: 3 x 3 minutes @ 20km time-trial intensity with 3-minute active recovery<br/>
Week 10: 4 x 3 minutes @ 20km time-trial intensity with 3-minute active recovery<br/>
Week 11: 5 x 3 minutes @ 20km time-trial intensity with 3-minute active recovery<br/>
Week 12: (Recovery) 3 x 3 minutes @ 20km time-trial intensity with 3-minute active recovery</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/01/21/wordpress-boosts-free-storage-to-3gb-leaves-blogger-typepad-in-the-dust/">techcrunch.com</a> posted &#8220;In a move that will no doubt put pressure on competing blog platforms TypePad (from Six Apart) and Blogger (from Google), WordPress (from Automattic) is boosting free storage for all the blogs it hosts from 50 MB to 3 GB. Founder Matt Mullenweg notes that is three times as much free space as Blogger currently offers, and that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d have to pay $300 a year to get as much storage on TypePad. The increase is made possible because WordPress uses AmazonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s S3 storage service, and it is passing on increased efficiencies on to its customers.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have used all three platform, I discarded TypePad at first try, it was not the experience I am looking for. I prefer blogspot over wordpress.com because you are allow to use scripts on blogspot. For wordpress.com supporters, the main problem would be storage space. They need 3rd partly source to host images and video when their blog gets too big. We be expecting blogger and Typepad to response to this soon, and when that happens more storage for everyone.</p>

<p>How many of you are still on wordpress.com, blogger.com$, or Typepad.com?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have accumulated 3 more domains yesterday, but only 1 websites is fully functional. This adds up to my current websites and boasts my inventory count to 11. How do one manage 11 websites (I have 4 more coming) and not to mention the few sites that are running on free hosts?</p>

<p>I have currently 3 active blogs, 3 aggregators, 4 forums, a drupal communtiy site, 1 IM site and 1 myspaces resources site. Out off this 11 the only one that I need to really work on is only this blog which is one of the 3 active blogs. I post onces a day here, a scale down of 4 last year. The other 2 blogs are sports and technology which content can be easily found and updated without much writing. I update them every 2 or 3 days. I still working on the 3 aggregator sites, I don&#8217;t scrape full contents, but I am still unable to make it look like a news sites. These sites require very little of my time, most of the time I am working on the codes. The 4 forums are newly setup, I am promoting them and active anchoring them with interesting topics. I spend less than 30 mins on 4 of them each day. Drupal sites is stuck at design, I am not sure what to do with it yet. Myspaces resources requires no effort from me.</p>

<p>I feel if you found some spared time everyday, don&#8217;t waste it, start a new site. It can be a blog, a simple website or a forum. Who knows what might become of them a year later. Even if you have a job, you can easily manage 3 blogs, and if 1 make a $100 a month 3 will give you a spare cash of $300. Need $10,000 to replace your job, make 1000 websites.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8220;Boy, you got to pay attention to details!&#8221;. I just read the clickbank FAQ, I guess I am the last person on planet earth who missed this. I put all my clickbank affiliate links on iframe. If you don&#8217;t not what I taking about read the 2 clause below.</p>

<p><em><strong>10. Will I get referral credit if I hide hoplinks by making them open into a frame, iframe, layer, applet, image, or other sub-window object?</strong></em></p>

<p><em>No. These are illegal hoplinks. For security reasons, and to ensure proper tracking of your referrals, all hoplinks must be targeted to the top level of a new or existing window.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>11. What happens if I do make illegal hoplinks?</strong></em></p>

<p><em>The short answer is that if you make illegal hoplinks you will lose money.</em></p>

<p><em>Hoplinks targeted to frames or iframes are automatically retargeted to fill the top level of same window, with full affiliate referral credit awarded. Note that this retargeting may have the unintended effect of displacing your entire web site.</em></p>

<p><em>Hoplinks targeted to images or other invisible html objects give you no affilate referral credit at all. In some cases they will also prevent you from receiving affiliate referral credit for legal hoplinks on the same page.</em></p>

<p><em>Accounts that are found to be abusing the hoplink system may be terminated without notice.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This a <a href="http://www.wickedfire.com/affiliate-marketing/21700-recipe-200k-per-year-job.html">post</a> I came across at the wickedfire.com forum by vladi. I am not sure the authenticity of the post but I like what he said in the end &#8220;Use your brains.  Thin outside the box and be creative. I did, and it paid off. &#8221;</p>

<p>I copy the post below.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;OK, you ready to find out how you can earn AT LEAST $200K in 2008?</em></p>

<p><em>Local Search Engine Control</em></p>

<p><em>If you&#8217;re like me, I use Google or have used Google in the past to find restaurants or supply shops in my area. If I am looking for a chinese place because I just moved to the city of OceanSide, then I type in:</em></p>

<p><em>oceanside &#8220;chinese restaurant&#8221;</em></p>

<p><em>What I see is that there are roughly 25,000 listings for that phrase. That&#8217;s under the 40K mark which I set for myself as an upper limit for a niche term to dominate. This becomes important, as you will see in a minute.</em></p>

<p><em>Using whatever methods you want to build pages that will get ranked (usually social network building) you can pretty much get anywhere from 1 to all 10 listings on the first page of Google for that 3 word phrase. There are a variety of ways to do this, but I am not going to get into that, because that is an extensive course in of itself.</em></p>

<p><em>If the search results were over 40K results, then it would be tougher. If there are only 5,000 results, then you&#8217;d probably get all 10 results on the first page. For example:</em></p>

<p><em>rosamond &#8220;chinese restaurant&#8221;</em></p>

<p><em>So I could dominate the city of Rosamond, Ca. for this niche. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a small town out by a race track on the outskirts of L.A. county.</em></p>

<p><em>OK, so where do you go with this? Easy. Here&#8217;s what I did.</em></p>

<p><em>Let&#8217;s say we start with Rosamond. You go in and you capture all 10 spots (or as many as you can) for the key phrase you are going after, and on those pages you promote a fake chinese restaurant. Where the name of the restaurant would go, you call it &#8220;Your-Name-Here Chinese Restaurant.&#8221; There should be links on the page to one or two high PR restuarant guides, as this will give you even more link juice and help you capture as many of the listings on the 1st page of Google. You also link to your website where you describe your services, and you have a phone #.</em></p>

<p><em>Next you put together some kind of marketing campaign for restaurants. You want to hit all the restaurants in that city, whether they be chinese or pizzarias. Doesn&#8217;t matter. You do some direct mail pieces to them. You have to have REALLY good creative in this piece to grab their attention. If you arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a great writer, outsource this to elance, or invest in a really good copyrighting course.</em></p>

<p><em>Tell these owners how they may increase their revenue by 208% (or whatever percentage is factual based on how you spin what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re telling them) by being on the 1st page of Google, blah, blah, blah. Pull up the stats and make it compelling. 80 to 90% of people wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t look past the 1st search results page. Use stuff like that.</em></p>

<p><em>The clincher here is you tell them that you put your money where your mouth is. You wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t charge them a cent unless you can get a page on the first Google results page that mentions their company and is fully controlled by them. This means they can say whatever they want on the page. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need to make sure it still has enough anchor text and keyword text to not drop its listing spot.</em></p>

<p><em>Now you can charge them for this service. In my case, this was a $900 one time charge, or $197 down and then $97 per month for a year. Most take the $900, ONCE they see results.</em></p>

<p><em>But what really sells them is that I tell them to go to Google and do the search term for the ROSAMOND Ã¢â‚¬Å“CHINESE RESTAURANTÃ¢â‚¬ , just to show them that I can do what I say. I tell them that in less then 2 weeks, I have displaced all of the Rosamond, Ca. Chinese restaurants, pushing them off the first page, and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see that I now control those pages. Hell, I could now put text on that page that says:</em></p>

<p><em>Ã¢â‚¬Å“Why would you eat Chinese food when you could have a delicious Pizza at TonyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family Pizzaria. BLAH BLAH BLAHÃ¢â‚¬  Believe me, I have sold Chinese pages to Hamburger joints or sea food places. They are cut throat and want to advertise to anybody looking for a restaurant to eat at. You donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to do this, and you can reserve those Chinese pages just for a Chinese restaurant. You create scarcity, and people will be compelled to buy (thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a whole different educational course.)</em></p>

<p><em>YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be surprised how many businesses see that you have done what you said and want you to do that for their business in their category. You can make it even better by telling them that once that restaurant type is taken (one store only), that its closed, and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s it. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a Chinese Restaurant owner, the last thing you want is for one of your competing Chinese Restaurants to own the majority of the 1st page rankings on Google, especially when your restaurant doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even show up on the first 40 results. And trust me sir, I have sent the same offer to ALL of your competitors. I only need one of you to say YES and then the offer is closed.</em></p>

<p><em>I doubled my income when I changed the formula a bit. For people that wanted to me on the monthly plan, I told them that I wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t charge them anything, but the price was $900 if I could get them on the 1st page. I would then charge an extra $200 for every additional listing I got on the first page. On average, I was able to get 6 to 7 listings per page. The bill would be over $2K and I would tell them that I would make them a deal. If they pay me the $900 upfront for the 1st listing, I would take the remaining $1,200 (6 other listings) and knock it down to just 2 more payments of $200 each, spread out over the next 60 days, or $200 right now (ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s $1,100 total), and 75% of the time I would get my money up front right then and there, because the owners want to save $$$.</em></p>

<p><em>This is important because sometimes a city is too small and just doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get a lot of traffic through Google, so the owner may feel they arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t getting their moneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth if they track their online traffic to their website or phone # or coupons, etc., and they stop paying you. You are in the business of making money, not trying to collect it.</em></p>

<p><em>Another thing is you should never give up the logins and pwÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s to the pages you have created, to the owner, until you are fully paid. I learned this lesson the hard way when I got stiffed and tried to go in and slap the owner and restaurant on the very pages I had created for him, but he had gone in and changed the passwords.</em></p>

<p><em>I could write 10X more than what I have now, but this should already have gotten your brain going.</em></p>

<p><em>Why am I posting this? Surely I will get competition right? EhÃ¢â‚¬ ¦. Maybe, but hereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s my thought on it. First, 99.99% of people will never take action. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a proven fact. I bet 99.9% of the forum users here have ebooks they have downloaded that they havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even read yet. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just the way we are built. We scramble and want to move on to the next thing. For that 0.01% that does take action, good for them. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plenty of room.</em></p>

<p><em>There are roughly 20,000 cities in the USA alone. I could do this in Canada too, remember! And there are at least 10 different major types of restaurants (Chinese, Japanese, Italian, Irish, Sushi, BuffetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, etc.) ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s over 200,000 potential paying accounts, IF only just one of them per city per category type signed up. You could easily sell 2 or 3, making that 400K or 600K paying customers At my rates, the 200K is $180 million dollars, assuming I never upsold them. And thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just one category. I only tap a very small fraction of this amount. And every few years, most restaurants are out of business and you have a whole new pool of customers that have replaced them. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s great!</em></p>

<p><em>What if instead of restaurants I want to go after car stereo shops, or fitness centers, or dentists, etc. There are hundreds, maybe thousands of niches you can get into.</em></p>

<p><em>Instead of brick and morter shops, you could go after online websites and do this globally. Now you have access to tens of millions of businesses!</em></p>

<p><em>IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve done it part time, outsourcing almost all of it, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s generated well into the 6 figures per year. 2008 will probably double for me. This is just one of the many things I do, and one of the smaller ones.</em></p>

<p><em>Please donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t PM me about this, as I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have time for individual chatting or tutoring. If you have questions or comments, post them here for everybody to share.</em></p>

<p><em>I would love to hear from those of you who actually do this. Post your results here in this thread.</em></p>

<p><em>And before you post a question, really THINK about what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re about to ask. 90% of what I see asked in this forum is really annoying because the answers are readily available if you only did a quick Google search. Use your brains. Thin outside the box and be creative. I did, and it paid off.&#8221;</em></p>
