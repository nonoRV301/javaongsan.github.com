  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many beginning bloggers stays in front of their monitor for more than 18 hours, sacrificing other aspect of their life, hoping to make it big in a short period of time. Well there&#8217;s nothing wrong with having goals, our social life, families and health surfers. When you bitten by that online bug, it&#8217;s extremely difficult to pull yourself away from your computer. I found myself working on my laptop most of the time and every spare moment I have, I push that power button on tiny laptop. Working on new programs, writing new articles, reading emails or simply surfing the internet for information, gives the feeling that I am doing something fruitful and contributing to my goal.</p>

<p>If you fall in this category, you better be single, with no family, friends and not interested in your health. If not, it&#8217;s time to make some changes. Many successful entrepreneurs mention that your success are determine by your daily habits. To be successful, you need to do a few repeated routines each day that propels you towards your long term goal.</p>

<p><strong>Goals</strong>
Goals starts with a dream, that what motivates you to do what ever it takes to achieve it. You are not familiar with setting goals, I suggest you write down a few things at least 25 things that you wanted to accomplish in 5 years time in every aspect of your life, career, family, heath, social, etc. Goals must be precise with a definite date and a measurable unit. Example, if you want to be rich, your goal is NOT &#8220;I want to be rich in future&#8221;. First you did not define future, and you did not define rich, you could end up with a 50 cents more in your pocket when you are 80 years old. A proper statement will be &#8220;I am happy to received $50,000 passive income each month from my blog on 30 Feb 2008&#8221;. Once you have you goal you need to set up a series of daily activities that will help you nail that goal. We call this daily habits, which might be to post 3 times a day, study and research 1 new blog, enroll in a mentoring program like <a href="http://javaongsan.github.com/recommends/blogmastermind/">blogmastermind</a>. These activities should contribute to a monthly goal which adds up to your finally goal. In other words work back from your final goal.</p>

<p>Setting Up A Daily Schedule
Once you have your daily habits, set a minimum time for each task. This forms up your basic time table. Timetable can be divided into blocks of 2 hours or less, to your preferences. I prefer 2 hours personally, I have attention time spend of 45 minutes or less, preparing each task takes about 5-15 minutes and finishing details about 20 minutes. Once your main block of time is filled, you can now set up time for family, friends and health. Having quality time with your family, playing time with your children, partners, will be the most important and most unpredictables. You may have your kids first school play to attend and you definitely do not want to miss this. You have a anniversary coming up and you may need to plan a dinner which may occupied a block of time allocated for work. In case like these it is good to have a flexible schedule. Keep the basis of your schedule but plan it every week, that allows flexibility and arrangement of unexpected events. The second most important would be health which includes regular exercise, mental/personal development and nutrition.  This simply translate to eat healthy at fixed time, doing some form of exercise at certain time of the day and reading or listening to some form of personal improvement stuffs. Social life is equally important, you want to keep friends and make more, theres no fun being a loner.</p>

<p>Have a clear picture of what you need to achieve each day. Plan wisely make every minute count. Most entrepreneurs utilize every minute to complete a task. We all have the same amount of time each day, the only different is how the sucessful people are utilizing them. Most entrepreneurs wakes up at the same time each morning regardless of when they go to bed. They have a few books or cds in hand, they read in a queue, when traveling, even in the toilet. They do not pick up their phone and they don&#8217;t answer every call. It about how you value your time.</p>

<p>Once you have every aspect of your life plan out, you can true lead a balanced lifestyle thats fun and fulfilling on your journey to your success. Balance is the key to unlocking the door of success. A Journey like this should be traveled along, its always exciting to meet people who heading towards the same destination. So smell the flower once in awhile. It&#8217;s ok to take a break and leave your work desk, it will still be there when you come back but not your family, friends and health.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>The importances of getting to know your reader</strong>
If you have ever tried blogging for money, you will be aware of the importance of choosing the right content for your target audience. Only when your giving your audience what they are looking for, they will will start to trust you and purchase some of the products that you are selling or promoting. To achieve this, you need know your audience, their interests, likes and dislikes. Know your audience and their needs, use this knowledge to help design your blog and write your posts.</p>

<p><strong>Who is your target reader?</strong>
To get to know your readers better, you can start to profile your readers. Set up Google Analytics, Mybloglog, look at comments, email them and study and come up with a way to identified and categories them. You can define such characteristics such as spending power, age, interest etc. With a target reader profile you should find it easier to generate the content that will appeal to them.</p>

<p>When you know what the audience wants and likes, when you know your audience, they become more interested in what you have to say. Often the blogger does not even have to be a good writer, but if the audience feels there is good communication, they will listen and enjoy the post. Knowing the audience can result in the benefits you want.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Do you really need to blog daily in order to make money? While thats only true if you have 1 miserable blog. What you really need is to change what you been hearing and reading about blogging. This month alone I have blog once a week or less, and my income have been better than when I was doing it daily. Why? This blog simply isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a suitable money maker. When I stopped focusing on just one blog and expanded to 4 blogs. I have more options to play with, doing paid posts, selling links, I could sell bulk links just by spinning out sub domain blogs, sell ad space.</p>

<p>Blog shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be the only type of website you create, forums, other portal sites, fan sites, etc are options to explore. The best sites are sites that needs minimal maintenances and have self generated contents, like forums. Expanding is the way to go, till you find that one sites thats pulling in the top income and focus on it solely. Basically, the formula is to create a couple of site, kill the sinking ones keep the good ones, and repeat the process.</p>

<p>Before you go Ã¢â‚¬Å“hihohiho off to workÃ¢â‚¬ , you will need tools. You need to be able to build website fast and the only way is to customize your very own version of CMS Content Management System. With this customized CMS, it will be plug and play. Within seconds, you have your site site site setup with all the plugin you need and all the ad codes already in place. You may choose to create your cms on your own or engage a programmer to do it for you.</p>

<p>To be profitable,  you always on the look ou, reading analyzing the latest trend, testing, experimenting and fine tuning. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s make you an Internet Entrepreneur.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://images.apachefriends.org/images/1240.jpg" alt="" />Xampplite is a cool tool. If you need to work on php and mysql and move your code around work stations,
xampplite is really a good software to use. Just <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html">Download it</a>
and  unzip it into your thumb drive at the highest level,
it must be on the highest level like E:\ or W:. It will build E:\XAMPPlite or W:\XAMPPlite or something like this.
Start xampp by using the control center, xampp-control.exe, start Aapche and mysql using the user friendly interface.
Start your browser and type http://127.0.0.1 or http://localhost in the location bar. You should see the pre-made
start page with certain examples and test screens. Stick your usb dive into any computer, start control and run your
php under Drive:\XAMPPlite\htdocs\test.php => http://localhost/test.php. You can setup wordpress too.
Just unzip the installation file under wordpress under htdocs, create database  with phpmyadmin which can
be found on the default page http://localhost look under the left side bar. <img src="http://www.apachefriends.org/img/linsh1.png" alt="" />
I have been using Xampp to be build my own fast install version of wordpress. I coded some default values and removed annoying stuff like
default entries for blogroll. I hack an rss scrapper plugin. The goal is to be able to set up subdomain blog scrappers in a few seconds.
The whole idea of scrapper is to find backlinks through trackbacks. If you add a like to another post you get a link back just like a comment,
except trackbacks are 2 way links. If you do the math, you scrape 10 post = 10 links, if you scrape 10 post from 10 blogs you get 100 links, get the point?
If you throw in some keywords and do an rss search you get few hundred rss links, each have between 10-20 post, you get few hundred links instantly from each blog.
You can see a sample of my work at <a href="http://www.cappadon.com/">cappadon.com</a>. This a music aggreator site. The plan was to host mtv videos but I couldn&#8217;t
have time to look for a cms that will do it so for now its just a blog. This a used domain that I bought so I got some backlinks and all the traffic are from organic search engine.
Its a PR2 as well. Next, I will be working on forums like postnuke and cms like drupal. I will be done
with my day job next week, after that its back to full time online work.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/11/wheres-my-gphone.html">Google</a> announced Android, the first truly open and comprehensive platform for mobile devices. It includes an operating system, user-interface and applications for mobile phone, but without the proprietary obstacles that have hindered mobile innovation. Android was developed in cooperation with the Open Handset Alliance, which consists of more than 30 technology and mobile leaders including Motorola, Qualcomm, HTC and T-Mobile. Phones based on the Android platform are targeted for release on the second half of 2008.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a developer and this approach sounds exciting the <a href="http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/developers.html">SDK</a> might be available in a week or so.</p>

<p><strong>Further digging at </strong><a href="http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/android_overview.html"><strong>Open Handset Alliance</strong></a>
Androidâ„¢ will deliver a complete set of software for mobile devices: an operating system, middleware and key mobile applications. Android will be open source, it is built on the open Linux Kernel. Furthermore, it utilizes a custom virtual machine that has been designed to optimize memory and hardware resources in a mobile environment. Android does not differentiate between the phone&#8217;s core applications and third-party applications. They can all be built to have equal access to a phone&#8217;s capabilities providing users with a broad spectrum of applications and services. Android provides access to a wide range of useful libraries and tools that can be used to build rich applications. It sounds like a dream come true for mobile developers but can it really deliver.</p>

<p>On November 12, theres an frist look release of the Android Software Development Kit (SDK) for developers. Is this what we mobile developers have been looking forward to?</p>
