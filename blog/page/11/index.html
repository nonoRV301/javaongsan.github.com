  <div class="entry-content"><p>The actual question is What are your criteria for subscribing to a particular RSS feed? Feed count, popularity or simply because you like it? What ever your reason, you shouldn&#8217;t have a criteria. In fact, my suggestion is to subscribe to any blog you came across. like anyone else I don&#8217;t like to help a blog increased their feed count or readership by subscribing to them, especially when there are only 1 digit. I do not subscribe to any blog who I am not found of, or if I think they are boring, or for whatever reason. Since reading a post y John Chow about his idea of tracking a numerous blogs for ideas, I started to wonder. Could I be missing out on some valuable informations by refusing to subscribe to a blog? I think the answer is obvious. Now that I amÃ‚   writingÃ‚   more blog, I need more informations,Ã‚   someÃ‚   in specific niche, I found that its really useful to read more blogs. Not only does it generate new ideas for content, some of them have good writing styles which I can follow. I may also be tracking blogs that are starting out and testing certain techniques on blogging or affiliate marketing. There a lot of things that I learn through other people&#8217;s experiences.</p>

<p>Many will argue the time I wasted tracking so many feeds, well I not going for PHD here so I don&#8217;t study every single content in details, I simple do a quick scan of all the titles and pick out a few that I will go through. You may also used different readers, or create different foldersÃ‚   to separate the feeds. A golden rule that I live by now &#8220;Only Subscribe, Do Not Unsubscribe!&#8221;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s the start of a new month and that means it&#8217;s time for do our income report. I been making money from blogging and other online marketing methods since May 2007. I always treat it as a game, trying to break new high score every month. I have made from varies source (see my <a href="http://wizcodersolution.com/2007/11/10/money-maker-2/">money makers</a>) but I did not manage to keep a steady source which look more like a hit and run.</p>

<p>During the new year I made decision to break the $300 mark and achieve $500 per month, and double it each month after. Keep in mind I have accumulated 14 sites now. So how did I do for January.</p>

<p><strong>Total Blog Income For January 2008: $</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://javaongsan.reseller.hop.clickbank.net/">clickbank</a></p>

<p>$17.98</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sponsoredreviews.com/?aid=2496">sponsoredreviews.com</a></p>

<p>45.5</p>

<p><a href="http://www.smorty.com/?B=3186">Smorty.com</a></p>

<p>6</p>

<p><a href="http://www.blogsvertise.com/?rid=b3260">Blogsvertise </a></p>

<p>31</p>

<p>Adsense</p>

<p>10</p>

<p><strong>Total </strong></p>

<p><strong>$110.48</strong></p>

<p>Despite making an effort to increase my earning from blogs and Adsense sites, I neglected the more profitable ebook sale sites. Although Adsense earning decline, I been getting pretty good ads on my blogs. One of my recurring problem is that my VPS tend to crash from time to time. I have figure out the problem yet.</p>

<p>Advertising expenses for the month was $0.2 and VPS Hosting $44.5. I also purchased $144.85 worth of domains. So this is not a profitable month. For next month, I will double the earning of this month.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think I am losing my fitness. I only managed to get bronze for IPPT. I been have a week feeling in the legs for weeks, it feel like there no power in my tights. I also injured my groin muscles and have a slight dislocation from right shoulder. Last week I pulled a abdominal muscle when I was doing my tumble turn. I guess its time to put up my legs and take a break for now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are lots of debate on the number of blog one should have. Most successful bloggers are likely to write only one blog and it seems like you only need one blog to be profitable. What happens when your blog did not take off? Maybe there are no readers, not enough traffic, or simply a bad niche? I do believe that if you work hard on one blog alone, you eventually get there, but what about when you have not make it yet. Your blog have too little traffic or readers to sell advertisement and your Adsense earning is only a few cents for entire month.</p>

<p>When I started, I started 5 blogs and only kept 2. Overtime I have started new blogs, keep some going and shutdown some. I was working on a full-time job back then, I still found time to work each blog daily. There are many benefits of starting multiple blogs. You have a sharper learning curve, you save time by experimenting different things on different blogs. After a period of time, you will shutdown the less preforming ones and work on the better performing ones. You choose to let this discarded blog float, where you might find some use for them in the future or use it to link to some of your websites, you might even be able to sell links or advertising spaces on them.</p>

<p>While most of my blog were started with free host, I have found that time and time again that if you host your own blog, you get better traffic fast. I have one blog lunch that will gain organic traffic the next day. Of course there a lot more SEO tactics involved but then again you can&#8217;t use them on free hosts like blogger.</p>

<p>I doÃ‚   recommend you start as many blogs as you can, even 1 a day is not too much. Start them on a good domain name. Pack them with contents,Ã‚   try to write as many post as possible till you run dry of content before your lunch. Always have a sitemap and submit them to the search engines. Always have some kind of tracking code like Google analytics where you are to track keywords and popular post. Once you get a couple of blog, you can make money by doing paid posts, selling links or ad space, or you can sell the entire blog.</p>

<p>Just in case you are wondering I run 7 blogs now. Its definitely more profitable than when I am running one.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Quick and dirty way to make $100 a day.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use <a href="http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-2613438-10405191">Go Daddy Bulk Domain Registration</a><img src="http://www.ftjcfx.com/image-2613438-10405191" alt="" /> and grad 100 domains.</p></li>
<li><p>Get a host, VPS prefer, from <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-2613438-10378494">GoDaddy.com Hosting Plans</a><img src="http://www.ftjcfx.com/image-2613438-10378494" alt="" /> or somewhere better.</p></li>
<li><p>Download install wordpress with plugging like adsense-deluxe.php, google-sitemap-generator, and feedwordpress on all 100 domains.</p></li>
<li><p>Setup rss feeds with feedwordpress. I prefer to use technorati search.</p></li>
<li><p>Slap on Adsense.</p></li>
<li><p>Submit sitemap to Google webmaster central.</p></li>
<li><p>Go Live</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Almost immediate, you start getting organic traffic from search engines. Adsense earning will start going up eventually will float around $1 after a week for each domain. For 100 domains, you make $100 a day. Its get more stable after a month and die off after that. Before that you could get 1 or 2 months of good organic traffic with almost 1000 uniques a day on 1 technorati tags.</p>

<p>If we work it out.</p>

<p>$1 x 100 (domains) x 60 (2 months) = $6000 - $700 (domain cost) - $50 (hosting) = $5 250.</p>

<p>Of course there several , downside to this techniques beside ethical issues. The original content owner will be unhappy and threaten you to remove their content. You also have a bandwidth issue, if you hosting bandwidth is too small, you site crash frequently. You also have redesign these 100 domains after they loose steam. Sometimes a website can die prematurely after a few days if you are not well verse in SEO.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every year, on Valentines Day I send flowers to my wife&#8217;s office, that a big for deal for the ladies. If you haven&#8217;t notice, pay attention when a bouquet arrives and how every single one of them get excited about it.  As a guy ordering and getting flowers is a nightmare, not to mention the treatment from those unfriendly shop assistances. I would normally place my order a week before on a website <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=108912&amp;u=193030&amp;m=7726&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=">www.Flora2000.com!</a>. I have using the website for a few years and they have always delivered. If you wondering what to get your ladies, I recommend sending a dozen roses, its the best gift I know of.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of my weakness is not able to ride strong. When it gets down to crunch time my legs felt like jelly. The only way I am going to improve this season is a giant leap through biking. Recently I have a strain near my groin area which has slowed down my running and swimming. Old man are starting to zoom pass me at my regular running route. I hope that this 12 week plan will put some power back into my legs.</p>

<p>Following is a 12-week schedule from <a href="http://www.triathletemag.com/Departments/Training/2007/Ride_with_more_muscle_this_season.htm">triathletemag.com</a> of neuromuscular-training workouts that are designed to:<br/>
1) increase your muscle-activation potential during cycling and then;<br/>
2) increase the endurance characteristics of your newly recruited fast-twitch fibers.</p>

<p>Be sure to warm up thoroughly before doing these high-intensity efforts and to cool down thoroughly afterwards. The 30-second hill sprints should be performed on the steepest hill you can find. The one-minute hill sprints may be done on a shallower hill and will be done at a slightly lower intensity. Just spin slowly for recovery. Every fourth week is a scaled-back recovery week to prevent overtraining. By the end of week 12 you’ll be ready to race—with more muscle than ever.</p>

<p>Week 1: 4 x 30-sec. hill sprints w/ 2-min. active recoveries<br/>
Week 2: 6 x 30-sec. hill sprints w/ 2-min. active recoveries<br/>
Week 3: 8 x 30-second hill sprints with 2-minute active recovery<br/>
Week 4: (Recovery) 6 x 30-second hill sprints with 2-minute active recovery<br/>
Week 5: 6 x 1-minute hill sprints with 2-minute active recovery<br/>
Week 6: 8 x 1-minute hill sprints with 2-minute active recovery<br/>
Week 7: 10 x 1-minute hill sprints with 2-minute active recovery<br/>
Week 8: (Recovery) 6 x 1-minute hill sprints with 2-minute active recovery<br/>
Week 9: 3 x 3 minutes @ 20km time-trial intensity with 3-minute active recovery<br/>
Week 10: 4 x 3 minutes @ 20km time-trial intensity with 3-minute active recovery<br/>
Week 11: 5 x 3 minutes @ 20km time-trial intensity with 3-minute active recovery<br/>
Week 12: (Recovery) 3 x 3 minutes @ 20km time-trial intensity with 3-minute active recovery</p>
