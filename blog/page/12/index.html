  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are some good old post that offers great ideas on how to launch a  forum.</p>

<p>Ahmed Bilal offers some tips with this post <a href="http://performancing.com/how-to-launch-a-forum-on-your-blog">How to launch a forum on your blog</a><br/>
_ # I hope you have friends as bloggers in your niche - leverage relationships to help give exposure to your forum through other blogs (note, you might want to offer an incentive - an offer for their readers, perhaps). It pays to make friends though._</p>

<p><em># Create linkbait in advance and publish them on the day the forum launches - then use the resulting attention and traffic and funnel it to the forum. It&#8217;s cheap, and requires some effort, but matched with your existing blogging community this tactic alone can give your forum the initial push it needs to survive.</em></p>

<p><em># Pre-populate the forum with some posts and threads so that it&#8217;s not totally empty. One tactic is to email regular readers and co-bloggers and get them to &#8216;start&#8217; on the forum a day or two before the actual launch. Real posts are always better than you creating 10 different IDs and posting under them.</em></p>

<p><em># Building up interest in the forum in advance is a no-brainer, but instead of putting up announcements about it run a competition and give out a prize, make the competition winnable only through the forum and then promote that prize / competition everywhere. It&#8217;s been done before, but it works.</em></p>

<p><em># Got some spare cash? Pay a popular blog to cover your forum - find a proper angle to suit that blogger&#8217;s audience if necessary.</em></p>

<p>Yaro Starak offers his advice on <a href="http://www.entrepreneurs-journey.com/568/how-to-launch-a-forum-with-an-instant-audience/">How To Launch A Forum With An Instant Audience</a><br/>
_ &#8220;HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a strategy for launching a buzzing forum from day one - create an uber-popular blog first, then launch a forum and bring your existing blog audience over to it._</p>

<p><em>Steve Pavlina has done just that launching his brand new Personal Development for Smart People Forums. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s already reported explosive traffic growth at the forums and as I type this there are over 270 people on the forum with registrations numbers over 1000 and I expect the growth wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be stopping any time soon.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Other good launch idea are to offer discounts and prizes for those who post the most during a certain time. Rewards often attracts attention and creates buzz. I have seen forums offering some cash gift for people with highest posts every week and they do work well. It works very well and really does get the posting going.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Forums can be a great way to create more profit for your business. The big forums can make a fortune but unless you can generate 1,000s of visitors a day forget it. One of the key factors for profitable forums is getting people to sign up. If you have no visitors or members, your forum will never grow. You need people in your forum and you need them to be talking about things that will get others to join in. You need make things interesting and create topics that people are interested in. Nonone will join an empty forums. You need to invest time to make your forum look professional.</p>

<p>Make it Easy to Join<br/>
First make the registration process as easy as possible. Just ask for username, name and email address for a start. Make it in a way members can fill out their full profile at a later date.</p>

<p>Get Subscribers Early<br/>
DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wait for opening day to get people to sign up for your forum. You can get friends and current customers to post early and help you test it; then, when people come to your forum for the first time, it will already appear active.</p>

<p>Promoting your forum on other forum<br/>
Other related forum can be a good place to promote your forum but be careful to not to look as thought you are snatching their members. Add a link to it in your signature where the forum users there can also offer their opinions at your.</p>

<p>Make active members moderators<br/>
Once your have a pool of active users, look for the most active one make them moderators. This will make them feel like they are part of your forum community and take the work of moderating for spam of your hand.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most people understand the basics of SEO and generating traffic. You need good content that people are looking for and keep the contents updated. Many SEO followers would start a blog because of this reason however generating content is never easy, a blog post needs to be a mnum of 200 words to be of any effects. One of the easiest way to do generate content without your own effort is to start a forum,  where subscribers create the content for you instead. I am sure that everyone knows about the value of having a forum. A forum is a community of a particular chosen niche that helps to generate revenue, rank higher on search engines. With lots of information and discussion being exchanged in your forums visitors will return again and again to see replies to their posts, read others posts and basically to see if anything has changed or if opinions have swayed to their side. A forum can be a place for people to discuss issues, share knowledge and generate relationships.</p>

<p>The very first thing to do is to decide a niche topic for your forum. I suggest you only consider starting a forum site about something that you have a strong interest in yourself. There are a surprising number of headaches running a forum. Even with the income I wouldn&#8217;t do it if I did not enjoy the topic. A hot tip on creating a good forum is to start a forum in a smaller niche where few quality boards exist. This will attract your core audience to discuss about a certain topic of interest. Do not add too many sub forums and keep all sub topics related to the your niche.</p>

<p>When starting up the first technical thing to consider is the platform for the forum. There are so many forum scripts you can choose from. Normally I prefer free forum scripts in php like phpBB3 which can ran on both windows and linux and they are provided by most web hosting companies. I would suggest you to start off with a free forum script, you can always migrate to other softwares later. Next, you need a reliable host for your forum, you can start off with basic package that cost around $4 a month and upgrade it when your forum grows. Now that you have everything setup, you just need to get visitors to join as a member.</p>

They re all build on phpBB3 which is free. Many people prefer vbulletin, but you need to purchase  a license. phpBB3 is pretty easy to use, installation is a breeze. There are several free skins available for free.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is an good post from <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2008/01/top-ten-myths-o.html">How to Change the World</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>It takes a lot of money to finance a new business.</strong> Not true. The typical start-up only requires about $25,000 to get going. The successful entrepreneurs who donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe the myth design their businesses to work with little cash. They borrow instead of paying for things. They rent instead of buy. And they turn fixed costs into variable costs by, say, paying people commissions instead of salaries.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Venture capitalists are a good place to go for start-up money.</strong> Not unless you start a computer or biotech company. Computer hardware and software, semiconductors, communication, and biotechnology account for 81 percent of all venture capital dollars, and seventy-two percent of the companies that got VC money over the past fifteen or so years. VCs only fund about 3,000 companies per year and only about one quarter of those companies are in the seed or start-up stage. In fact, the odds that a start-up company will get VC money are about one in 4,000. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worse than the odds that you will die from a fall in the shower.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Most business angels are rich.</strong> If rich means being an accredited investor Ã¢â‚¬â€œa person with a net worth of more than $1 million or an annual income of $200,000 per year if single and $300,000 if married Ã¢â‚¬â€œ then the answer is Ã¢â‚¬Å“no.Ã¢â‚¬  Almost three quarters of the people who provide capital to fund the start-ups of other people who are not friends, neighbors, co-workers, or family donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t meet SEC accreditation requirements. In fact, thirty-two percent have a household income of $40,000 per year or less and seventeen percent have a negative net worth.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Start-ups canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be financed with debt.</strong> Actually, debt is more common than equity. According to the Federal ReserveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Survey of Small Business Finances, fifty-three percent of the financing of companies that are two years old or younger comes from debt and only forty-seven percent comes from equity. So a lot of entrepreneurs out there are using debt rather than equity to fund their companies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Banks donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t lend money to start-ups.</strong> This is another myth. Again, the Federal Reserve data shows that banks account for sixteen percent of all the financing provided to companies that are two years old or younger. While sixteen percent might not seem that high, it is three percent higher than the amount of money provided by the next highest source Ã¢â‚¬â€œ trade creditors Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and is higher than a bunch of other sources that everyone talks about going to: friends and family, business angels, venture capitalists, strategic investors, and government agencies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Most entrepreneurs start businesses in attractive industries.</strong> Sadly, the opposite is true. Most entrepreneurs head right for the worst industries for start-ups. The correlation between the number of entrepreneurs starting businesses in an industry and the number of companies failing in the industry is 0.77. That means that most entrepreneurs are picking industries in which they are most likely to fail.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The growth of a start-up depends more on an entrepreneurÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s talent than on the business he chooses.</strong> Sorry to deflate some egos here, but the industry you choose to start your company has a huge effect on the odds that it will grow. Over the past twenty years or so, about 4.2 percent of all start-ups in the computer and office equipment industry made the Inc 500 list of the fastest growing private companies in the U.S. 0.005 percent of start-ups in the hotel and motel industry and 0.007 percent of start-up eating and drinking establishments made the Inc. 500. That means the odds that you will make the Inc 500 are 840 times higher if you start a computer company than if you start a hotel or motel. There is nothing anyone has discovered about the effects of entrepreneurial talent that has a similar magnitude effect on the growth of new businesses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Most entrepreneurs are successful financially.</strong> Sorry, this is another myth. Entrepreneurship creates a lot of wealth, but it is very unevenly distributed. The typical profit of an owner-managed business is $39,000 per year. Only the top ten percent of entrepreneurs earn more money than employees. And the typical entrepreneur earns less money than he otherwise would have earned working for someone else.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Many start-ups achieve the sales growth projections that equity investors are looking for.</strong> Not even close. Of the 590,000 or so new businesses with at least one employee founded in this country every year, data from the U.S. Census shows that less than 200 reach the $100 million in sales in six years that venture capitalists talk about looking for. About 500 firms reach the $50 million in sales that the sophisticated angels, like the ones at Tech Coast Angels and the Band of Angels talk about. In fact, only about 9,500 companies reach $5 million in sales in that amount of time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Starting a business is easy.</strong> Actually it isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, and most people who begin the process of starting a company fail to get one up and running. Seven years after beginning the process of starting a business, only one-third of people have a new company with positive cash flow greater than the salary and expenses of the owner for more than three consecutive months.</p></li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the constant struggle of webmaster is trying to  increase website traffic. No traffic is ever enough, when traffic stop growing, the income of the website stops as well. One of the best way increased traffic, sign ups or sales with no cost is using traffic exchange. <a href="http://wizcodersolution.com/recommends/trafficswarm/">TrafficSwarm</a> is one of the largest traffic exchange out there.</p>

<p><strong>What is <a href="http://wizcodersolution.com/recommends/trafficswarm/">TrafficSwarm</a></strong><br/>
First of all What is traffic exchange? A traffic exchange basically allows members to trade views of their websites. Members join the program and earns credit by clicking on a advertisement that will lead to another website. When you accumulate enough credit, you will be able to put in an advertisement for your own website. <a href="http://wizcodersolution.com/recommends/trafficswarm/">TrafficSwarm</a> has been one my favorite and most effective traffic source. It is a bit different than others because it allows you to look at a group of classified ads first before clicking on the ones you want to see.</p>

<p><strong>Setting Up An Advertisement</strong><br/>
To set up your advertisement, on the bottom of the page and you&#8217;ll find Manage Your Site Promotions. This is where you add your own website URLs for others to see. You can select which category where your ads will appear.</p>

<p><strong>Earn More Credits</strong><br/>
To accumulate more credits you need to surf other sites, each sites pays 1-5 credits randomly. You can also earn a 100 free credits when you refer new members.  As with all similar programs on the web there&#8217;s a free version and a pro version.  To get optimum benefit it&#8217;s recommended that you use the pro version.  If you want to earn more credits simply upgrade to Pro member which cost $30 a month. Pro member benefits include better ad display, more credits per clicks, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Income Results</strong><br/>
Total number of visitors sent to my site on Dec 07: 104<br/>
Time spent to generate 100 credits perday: 30min<br/>
Total number sales: 2<br/>
Cost: $0 (I just upgraded to the Pro version for more traffic, but even the Pro version costs about a buck a day.)<br/>
Sale conversion rate: 2 in 104<br/>
Profit from TrafficSwarm: $54</p>

<p>The best part is that this program is actually worth the PRO upgrade. At $30 per month, in just one week, I make enough commissions to cover this cost.</p>

<p><strong>Advance Techniques</strong><br/>
I used a rather straight forward approach in catching sales. I direct my <a href="http://wizcodersolution.com/recommends/trafficswarm/">TrafficSwarm</a> traffic to my sales page. However, an effective lead capturing method is to used a squeeze page to capture leads. A squeeze page consist of a free bonus which will be given to users when they fill up and submit the opt-in forms. The email list can then be used to promote different products, as the list gets bigger so does your profit.</p>

<p>If you need traffic to your website or your client&#8217;s websites, try <a href="http://wizcodersolution.com/recommends/trafficswarm/">TrafficSwarm</a> today. Sign up for the Pro version if you are serious in a good traffic generator. New joiners are given with 100 free credits as  a bonus.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&#8217;re outside of North America, Latin America, and Japan, AdSense referrals will be retired. I wonder why?</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re in North America, Latin America, or Japan, the pricing structure for AdSense referrals is changing. Now Adsense no longer will be offering the $5 bonus or $2000 bonus, and the payout for referring a user who generates $100 with AdSense in the first 180 days will return to $100.</p>

<p>These changes will take place during the last week of January.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A referred user who reaches $100 within 180 days of signing up and who removes all payments holds before the change occurs will generate earnings of $250 for the referring publisher.</p></li>
<li><p>Any referred user who meets this conversion criteria after the change occurs will only generate $100 in earnings for the referring publisher. In addition, the $5 bonus will be removed at that time.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Do you make use of AdSense referral? How will this changes affect you?</p>
