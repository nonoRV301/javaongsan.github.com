  <div class="entry-content"><p>You must have rad all the buzz about Google new toy <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial">OpenSocial</a>. OpenSocial is a set of common APIs that make it easy to create and host social applications on the web. OpenSocial allows developers to write an application once that will run anywhere that supports the OpenSocial APIs. Global members of the OpenSocial community include <a href="http://www.myspace.com/">MySpace</a>, <a href="http://www.engage.com/e/home.htm">Engage.com</a>, <a href="http://www.friendster.com/">Friendster</a>, <a href="http://www.hi5.com/">hi5</a>, <a href="http://www.hyves.net/">Hyves</a>, <a href="http://www.imeem.com/">imeem</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="http://www.ning.com/">Ning</a>, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/index.html">Oracle</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?service=orkut&amp;continue=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.orkut.com%2FRedirLogin.aspx%3Fmsg%3D0%26page%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.orkut.com%252F&amp;hl=en-US&amp;rm=false&amp;passive=true">orkut,</a> <a href="http://www.plaxo.com/info">Plaxo</a>, <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/">Salesforce.com</a>, <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/">Six Apart</a>, <a href="http://www.tianji.com/index.html">Tianji</a>, <a href="http://www.viadeo.com/en/connexion/">Viadeo</a>, and <a href="http://www.xing.com/">XING</a>.</p>

<p>The  problem  with social networking  development for independent developer is portability.  Every social networking site has its own APIs. When a application is developed for one social networking site, it is not compatible with another. With OpenSocial, that problem is solved.  In order for developers to get started immediately, Orkut has opened a limited sandbox that you can use to start building  apps using the OpenSocial APIs.</p>

<p>OpenSocial is built upon Google Gadget technology. With the Google Gadget Editor and a simple key/value API, you can build a complete social app with no server at all. Of course, you can also host your application on your own servers if you prefer. In all cases, Google&#8217;s gadget caching technology can ease your bandwidth demands.</p>

<p>Review the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/docs/">OpenSocial API docs</a>. There are two ways to access the  OpenSocial API: client-side using the JavaScript API and server-side using RESTful data APIs. You can get some exposure by writing your first social gadget for <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/orkut/">Orkut</a>.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How&#8217;s your earning this month? October is a good month for me, I have my earning rebounded from $0 back to $166 plus. This month, I am not solely rely on blogging. I have expanded to other areas of making money. There also a lot more opportunities now that I have 3 sites with PRs. I should rewrite my list of money makers and make it more comprehensive. This guide will probably help a few people get up to $100 a month if they have not make money online before.</p>

<p>I have decided to put up as many sites to diversified my incomes. Many eggs in many baskets. The idea is to make money from multiple websites, all with residual incomes by creating websites that are self maintenance or needs very little maintenance needed. This month, I am exploring more area technically which is my strength rather than writing and marketing. I have now own a VPS which makes it easier for me to run scripts and host as many website. The cost is higher in October because of the VPS and a few expired domains. It will be good for this new site to support itself soon.</p>

<p>The coming month, you see less of my post. I have plan a couple of important onces like my research and result from leaving high PR comments, the list of money maker I mentioned and possibly a guide on setting up and using a VPS. This is all I can think of right now. It is going to be a busy  month a head.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apparently the PR update have left my <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/automatedtrafficmachine/">squidoo lens</a> with a PR3. Lately I have been working on my lens a bit keeping it fresh and stay on top 100 on the SEO category. I have converting some old blog post and writing some new ones. I like to see how much I have made form my lens from September onwards. Right now Squidoo only reports up to August earnings. I have also delete away all my other lens so the sole and surviving one looks more creditable. If interested in making money from squidoo, you check out some of my older articles on them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am shopping for a VPS. Anyone has any recommendations? A VPS Virtual Private Servers is the next best thing to a real full pledge server and more affordable. VPS is a virtual sever running on an actual server. One server ca run a few VPSs that why its more affordable. A dedicated server will cost you at least $125 per month while a VPS starts at $15. Why get a VPS? If you need to run programs that are not suitable for shared hosting and cant affordable dedicated server, VPS is a good choice.</p>

<p>I been lurking in forums, picking up reviews on various VPS companies. It seems that the cheaper ones have more support problem. Now it breaks down to how fast before I get my own dedicated server. If I can pull in enough income from the sites that I hosted than  I will go for something cheap but if I need to use the VPS for a while than I rather get something more reliable.</p>

<p>This is some of the VPS providers and cost I have researched, all this fall within my budget. http://www.knownhost.com/services/vps.html $20 cpanel + 7 Fair
http://www.Zone.net/ $25/month Poor
http://www.powervps.com/cpanel-vps.php $44.50 per month Good
http://www.vpsland.com/linuxplans.html $15.99 + 6 Poor
http://www.jaguarpc.com/vps-hosting/ $19.97 + 7 Fair</p>

<p>Of course, there are things like bandwidth and uptime that I should look at but a this point I probably going with powervps, unless someone have a better suggestion.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I saw a PR2 on my firefox Google toolbar. What happened? I though PR updates are all over. Then I read that there was a lot of discussion in the blogsphere about Google return some of the PR they have reduced. In my case I have never depended on PR or Traffic for my blog. May be I should put it this way, I used my blog as a journal and as a testing platform. However it was good to have a PR2, just to shut some naysayers up. Actually this domain used to be a PR3, so I not new to this. This time I was sure I will get some PR basically with the <a href="http://javaongsan.github.com/2007/09/14/easy-way-to-get-one-way-backlinks-from-high-pr-sites/">technique</a> I written.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>PHP and MySQL are the mot used programming tool and database. The primary reason is that they are free and are definitely more stable hosted on a more reliable platform like Unix or Linux. Of course not forgetting the Web Server, the trusty Apache.</p>

<p>If you are going to make money online, at certain time of your career, you need to pick up some programming skills. I don&#8217;t care how many big shot Internet Marketer told you that they made their millions hardly able to move the mouse on their own. To  build an online empire, you need to be able to design and build websites. I remember the first session of WIS was how to use frontpage, I personal feel you need to pick up PHP which is basically the free version of ASP. Although a lot more complex and coding have to done by hand, its will be worth well in the long run. I normally used www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp for references. You might prefer to buy a book or download a tutorial, print it or whatever.</p>

<p>You need to run a server, I recommend using XAMMP. Its a all in one package. Web server, PHP, mysql and many more. Its everything you need to start and its has a windows version so no linux installation is needed. For easier coding, I recommend using Notepad++, a multi language editor, what this does is that it convert PHP in a more readable format.</p>

<p>Learning a program language, should only take 2 hours if you have a good tutorial. Then you need to learn a unique skill which separates the classes of programmers. Debugging. If you are to debug a code you will be able to do anything you want. Good Analytical skills, discipline are required for coding, but no, not everyone turns into a geek. If you feel indifferent and wish to follow all the rest of the world and out source your programming work, getafreelancer and guru.com are good places. There&#8217;s a phrase Microsoft used to say and thats &#8220;PROGRAMMERS RULE THE WORLD!&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.rubyonrails.org/images/rails.png" alt="Ruby On Rails" />Ruby on Rails is a free web application framework that aims to increase the speed and ease with which database-driven web sites can be created and offers skeleton code frameworks (scaffolding) from the outset. Ruby on Rails was created by David Heinemeier Hansson, a Danish.</p>

<p>Ruby on Rails is based on Ruby is a reflective, dynamic, object-oriented programming language. It combines syntax inspired by Perl with Smalltalk-like object-oriented features, and also shares some features with Python, Lisp, Dylan, and CLU. Ruby is a single-pass interpreted language. Its official implementation is free software written in C. The language was created by Yukihiro &#8220;Matz&#8221; Matsumoto, who started working on Ruby on February 24, 1993, and released it to the public in 1995. &#8220;Ruby&#8221; was named as a gemstone because of a joke within Matsumoto&#8217;s circle of friends alluding to Perl&#8217;s name</p>

<p>You are able to develop a web application <em>at least</em> ten times faster with Rails than you can with a typical Java framework. Rails takes full advantage of Ruby, which means you write fewer lines of code to implement your application. Keeping your code small means faster development and fewer bugs, which makes your code easier to understand, maintain, and enhance.</p>

<p>Ruby on Rails have the ability to generate ready to use codes based on your database, which is MySQL most of the time. As a complete framework, its already web 2.0 ready. Whats lacking right now is the hosting for ruby. Most hosting company do not offer Ruby on Rails. Ruby on Rails have more potential as a full web 2.0 than PHP.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>![]Web hosting is important not only to the people who are using the website but the webmaster as well. I am currently fustrated by the issue with my web host. There was a problem connecting to my host and I have found this problem have always been there. Now that I have hosted my own blog, it is more obvious. I have to refresh my browser every time I make a connection, it would say error web server not available. I am using Godday.com Linux account, I can tell you they are not good enough.</p>

<p>I have look at bluehost. Bluehost was recommended by wordpress but seems to have read a lot of negative about it. The worst things is that theres only one price for there hosting. I have also look at bluefur, but I have not heard from them after signing up as an affiliate. Web hosting preferences have always been divided among webmasters. its mixed of good and bad in every company. I would actually prefer a local company to host my account, that way the access speed is higher. Thats nothing more frustrating than not able to publishing your work or losing it because of something like webhosting.</p>

<p>It be good to find a web host sponsor but right now I would like to know if theres  a better company out there.</p>

<p>Update:
I just received an email form bluefur.</p>

<p>Thank you for signing up for the bluefur.com Affiliate Program. We have reviewed your application and at this we do not feel there is a good match as partners. If you have any questions about why please direct them to affiliate@bluefur.com.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have just received my <a href="http://automatedt.reseller.hop.clickbank.net/">clickbank</a> pay cheque of USD $37. I only cash out because my account had been inactive for a while. I have not been actively promoting affiliate programs and beside I preferred <a href="http://https://www.paypal.com/row/mrb/pal=UJ87DTT6RHYAS">paypal</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Clickbank Payment Basics</strong>
The &#8220;Payment Threshold&#8221; setting in the clickbank account allows you to control when you receive a check. You may select an amount from $10 to $10,000 as your Payment Threshold. The default setting is $100. Your check is hold until your payable balance reaches the amount you select.</p>

<p><strong>Why is my balance decreasing?</strong>
Accounts with a positive balance but no earnings for an extended period of time are considered dormant. Dormant accounts are subject to a charge of $1 per pay period after 90 days of inactivity, $5 per pay period after 180 days of inactivity, and $15 per pay period after 365 days of inactivity.</p>

<p><strong>Bank charges </strong>
Handling commission : 1/8% of cheque amount subject to a minimum ofSGD10.00 and maximum of SGD100.00 Plus postage charge of SGD4.00
Overseas agent bank charge (differs, depending on the currency type andamount) USD5.00.
Thats a lot of money wasted and I have wait 3-4weeks.</p>

<p><a href="http://automatedt.reseller.hop.clickbank.net">Referral Program</a>
The only product I wish to promote is the <a href="http://automatedt.reseller.hop.clickbank.net">Referral Program</a>.
Clickbank  standard activation charge is $49.95, and you keep 20% of that, so you earn $9.99 up front.</p>

<p>Clickbank  typical markup is $1 + 7.5%, and you keep 5% of that, so you earn about $0.09 to $0.99 on every sale.</p>

<p>$10     sale     =     $0.09 commission
$20     sale     =     $0.13 commission
$30     sale     =     $0.16 commission
$40     sale     =     $0.20 commission
$50     sale     =     $0.24 commission
$100     sale     =     $0.42 commission
$150     sale     =     $0.61 commission
$200     sale     =     $0.80 commission
$250     sale     =     $0.99 commission</p>
