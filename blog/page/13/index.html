  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is an good post from <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2008/01/top-ten-myths-o.html">How to Change the World</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>It takes a lot of money to finance a new business.</strong> Not true. The typical start-up only requires about $25,000 to get going. The successful entrepreneurs who donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe the myth design their businesses to work with little cash. They borrow instead of paying for things. They rent instead of buy. And they turn fixed costs into variable costs by, say, paying people commissions instead of salaries.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Venture capitalists are a good place to go for start-up money.</strong> Not unless you start a computer or biotech company. Computer hardware and software, semiconductors, communication, and biotechnology account for 81 percent of all venture capital dollars, and seventy-two percent of the companies that got VC money over the past fifteen or so years. VCs only fund about 3,000 companies per year and only about one quarter of those companies are in the seed or start-up stage. In fact, the odds that a start-up company will get VC money are about one in 4,000. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worse than the odds that you will die from a fall in the shower.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Most business angels are rich.</strong> If rich means being an accredited investor Ã¢â‚¬â€œa person with a net worth of more than $1 million or an annual income of $200,000 per year if single and $300,000 if married Ã¢â‚¬â€œ then the answer is Ã¢â‚¬Å“no.Ã¢â‚¬  Almost three quarters of the people who provide capital to fund the start-ups of other people who are not friends, neighbors, co-workers, or family donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t meet SEC accreditation requirements. In fact, thirty-two percent have a household income of $40,000 per year or less and seventeen percent have a negative net worth.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Start-ups canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be financed with debt.</strong> Actually, debt is more common than equity. According to the Federal ReserveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Survey of Small Business Finances, fifty-three percent of the financing of companies that are two years old or younger comes from debt and only forty-seven percent comes from equity. So a lot of entrepreneurs out there are using debt rather than equity to fund their companies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Banks donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t lend money to start-ups.</strong> This is another myth. Again, the Federal Reserve data shows that banks account for sixteen percent of all the financing provided to companies that are two years old or younger. While sixteen percent might not seem that high, it is three percent higher than the amount of money provided by the next highest source Ã¢â‚¬â€œ trade creditors Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and is higher than a bunch of other sources that everyone talks about going to: friends and family, business angels, venture capitalists, strategic investors, and government agencies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Most entrepreneurs start businesses in attractive industries.</strong> Sadly, the opposite is true. Most entrepreneurs head right for the worst industries for start-ups. The correlation between the number of entrepreneurs starting businesses in an industry and the number of companies failing in the industry is 0.77. That means that most entrepreneurs are picking industries in which they are most likely to fail.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The growth of a start-up depends more on an entrepreneurÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s talent than on the business he chooses.</strong> Sorry to deflate some egos here, but the industry you choose to start your company has a huge effect on the odds that it will grow. Over the past twenty years or so, about 4.2 percent of all start-ups in the computer and office equipment industry made the Inc 500 list of the fastest growing private companies in the U.S. 0.005 percent of start-ups in the hotel and motel industry and 0.007 percent of start-up eating and drinking establishments made the Inc. 500. That means the odds that you will make the Inc 500 are 840 times higher if you start a computer company than if you start a hotel or motel. There is nothing anyone has discovered about the effects of entrepreneurial talent that has a similar magnitude effect on the growth of new businesses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Most entrepreneurs are successful financially.</strong> Sorry, this is another myth. Entrepreneurship creates a lot of wealth, but it is very unevenly distributed. The typical profit of an owner-managed business is $39,000 per year. Only the top ten percent of entrepreneurs earn more money than employees. And the typical entrepreneur earns less money than he otherwise would have earned working for someone else.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Many start-ups achieve the sales growth projections that equity investors are looking for.</strong> Not even close. Of the 590,000 or so new businesses with at least one employee founded in this country every year, data from the U.S. Census shows that less than 200 reach the $100 million in sales in six years that venture capitalists talk about looking for. About 500 firms reach the $50 million in sales that the sophisticated angels, like the ones at Tech Coast Angels and the Band of Angels talk about. In fact, only about 9,500 companies reach $5 million in sales in that amount of time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Starting a business is easy.</strong> Actually it isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, and most people who begin the process of starting a company fail to get one up and running. Seven years after beginning the process of starting a business, only one-third of people have a new company with positive cash flow greater than the salary and expenses of the owner for more than three consecutive months.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the constant struggle of webmaster is trying to  increase website traffic. No traffic is ever enough, when traffic stop growing, the income of the website stops as well. One of the best way increased traffic, sign ups or sales with no cost is using traffic exchange. <a href="http://wizcodersolution.com/recommends/trafficswarm/">TrafficSwarm</a> is one of the largest traffic exchange out there.</p>

<p><strong>What is <a href="http://wizcodersolution.com/recommends/trafficswarm/">TrafficSwarm</a></strong><br/>
First of all What is traffic exchange? A traffic exchange basically allows members to trade views of their websites. Members join the program and earns credit by clicking on a advertisement that will lead to another website. When you accumulate enough credit, you will be able to put in an advertisement for your own website. <a href="http://wizcodersolution.com/recommends/trafficswarm/">TrafficSwarm</a> has been one my favorite and most effective traffic source. It is a bit different than others because it allows you to look at a group of classified ads first before clicking on the ones you want to see.</p>

<p><strong>Setting Up An Advertisement</strong><br/>
To set up your advertisement, on the bottom of the page and you&#8217;ll find Manage Your Site Promotions. This is where you add your own website URLs for others to see. You can select which category where your ads will appear.</p>

<p><strong>Earn More Credits</strong><br/>
To accumulate more credits you need to surf other sites, each sites pays 1-5 credits randomly. You can also earn a 100 free credits when you refer new members.  As with all similar programs on the web there&#8217;s a free version and a pro version.  To get optimum benefit it&#8217;s recommended that you use the pro version.  If you want to earn more credits simply upgrade to Pro member which cost $30 a month. Pro member benefits include better ad display, more credits per clicks, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Income Results</strong><br/>
Total number of visitors sent to my site on Dec 07: 104<br/>
Time spent to generate 100 credits perday: 30min<br/>
Total number sales: 2<br/>
Cost: $0 (I just upgraded to the Pro version for more traffic, but even the Pro version costs about a buck a day.)<br/>
Sale conversion rate: 2 in 104<br/>
Profit from TrafficSwarm: $54</p>

<p>The best part is that this program is actually worth the PRO upgrade. At $30 per month, in just one week, I make enough commissions to cover this cost.</p>

<p><strong>Advance Techniques</strong><br/>
I used a rather straight forward approach in catching sales. I direct my <a href="http://wizcodersolution.com/recommends/trafficswarm/">TrafficSwarm</a> traffic to my sales page. However, an effective lead capturing method is to used a squeeze page to capture leads. A squeeze page consist of a free bonus which will be given to users when they fill up and submit the opt-in forms. The email list can then be used to promote different products, as the list gets bigger so does your profit.</p>

<p>If you need traffic to your website or your client&#8217;s websites, try <a href="http://wizcodersolution.com/recommends/trafficswarm/">TrafficSwarm</a> today. Sign up for the Pro version if you are serious in a good traffic generator. New joiners are given with 100 free credits as  a bonus.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&#8217;re outside of North America, Latin America, and Japan, AdSense referrals will be retired. I wonder why?</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re in North America, Latin America, or Japan, the pricing structure for AdSense referrals is changing. Now Adsense no longer will be offering the $5 bonus or $2000 bonus, and the payout for referring a user who generates $100 with AdSense in the first 180 days will return to $100.</p>

<p>These changes will take place during the last week of January.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A referred user who reaches $100 within 180 days of signing up and who removes all payments holds before the change occurs will generate earnings of $250 for the referring publisher.</p></li>
<li><p>Any referred user who meets this conversion criteria after the change occurs will only generate $100 in earnings for the referring publisher. In addition, the $5 bonus will be removed at that time.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Do you make use of AdSense referral? How will this changes affect you?</p>

<p>What happened?<br/>
&#8221;<em>A complication in the renewal process caused the Advertlets.com domain to expire, and caused issues for bloggers with our ads installed, which made their blogs redirect to a placeholder page.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Kevin Koskella of TriSwimCoach.com posted this interesting article over at <a href="http://www.triathletemag.com/Departments/Training/2007/Developing_the_proper_freestyle_kick.htm">triathletemag.com</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your kick is mainly for stability and body rotation. However, not having a kick or kicking improperly can lead to using twice as much energy to get through your swim! And nobody wants to get on their bike feeling drained and knowing that they still have a lot of work to be done. Let’s address these two challenges and see what can be done to remedy them:</p>

<p>1st Challenge: Having No Kick. While it is important to save your legs and enough energy for biking and running, not kicking will not help you achieve this. You need to develop a kick that works for you. There is no one size fits all with kicking, but it should be relatively rhythmic. In other words, work on developing a 2-beat, 3-beat, or even a 4-beat kick (2, 3, or 4 kicks for every stroke). A good drill to practice this rhythmic kick is 6 Kicks Per Stroke- exaggerating the number of kicks with each rotation.</p>

<p>2nd Challenge: Kicking Improperly. This is a common problem among many triathletes who have “runners’ kick”. What this really means is inflexible ankles, which create drag and force you to do a lot more work than necessary to get through the swim. There are 3 remedies to overcome Runner’s Kick:</p>

<p>1.Vertical Kicking drill. Find water that is deep enough for you to kick in place. Cross your arms, and kick in place in a vertical position (keep in a straight line), pointing your toes and keeping your chin above the surface of the water. Get your power from your quads and hips on this drill. Try 20 seconds at a time.<br/>
Click here for an instructional video</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use fins. Not just to &#8220;keep up&#8221; in workouts, but to actually improve your kick. If you have ankle flexibility issues, use fins for a few weeks, but wean off them as you get closer to your event. The shorter ones are best. I prefer Zoomers, but other brands may work okay as well. Fins can increase your ankle flexibility, allow you to do swimming drills with ease, and strengthen the right leg muscles you need to kick (improving on that 10-15%!)</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch your ankles. You can try sitting on your feet, or, in a seated position, take one leg and bring it out in front of you. Extend your feet and push your toes toward the ground. Hold for about 15-20 seconds, repeat with other foot. You can do this several times a day.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Whatever you do, don&#8217;t be tempted to use a kick board to improve your kick. For distance swimming and triathlons, you are wasting your time with the floatation devices!</p>

<p>Stick with the drills, work on a rhythmic kick, have patience, and you will be pleased with your swimming results!&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finally gotten the email on the much talk about <a href="http://bdv.bidvertiser.com/bidvertiser/referral_button.html?pid=57114">Bidvertiser</a> ads on rss feed. <br/>
Here are the steps to create a new rss feed url with bidvertiser ad: <br/>
1. Login to your publisher account and click &#8220;Add New BidVertiser&#8221;. During the Public Beta, you may also click the &#8220;Public Beta&#8221; link. If you are new to BidVertiser, click here to create a publisher account.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make sure you are under the BidVertiser for your Feed tab.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide your feed URL and title and click Next.</p></li>
<li><p>Verify your feed ownership by adding a temporary post with a unique verification code we provide you with.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose your favorite multiple-subscription Feed Widget and add it to your website or blog. Detail instructions for each of the major blog platforms is provided as part of the process.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The problem now is trying to get all your subscriber to subscribe to your new feed. I certainly not using this, I have been experiencing a sharp decline of rss suscriber. I think its time to kick in another gear and break that 1000 rss count limit.</p>

<p>These keywords can improve the volume and quality of traffic to a web site from search engines via &#8220;natural&#8221; (&#8220;organic&#8221; or &#8220;algorithmic&#8221;) search results. Usually, the higher a site is presented in the search results, the more searchers will visit that site. To scrape articles is easy, you can use free content from article directory, hire a writer, or get it from other blogs. All you need is to give credits to the original author. I suggest you scrape about 30 articles in one go and spread them out in your archives, that means creating this content in past dates. To get index fast you need to submit your new sitemap to <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/">Google Webmaster Central.</a></p>

<p>You be seeing some exciting traffic pretty soon, if you get your keywords right, you can get about 50-100 unique organic traffic per day.</p>
