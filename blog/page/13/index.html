  <div class="entry-content"><p>On the first day of 2008, I though we start off the year with a money making tip. Nothing is more effective than the tried and tested article marketing. The first step is Keyword Research. This will helps you find and pick the right keywords for your articles marketing campaign. For this, you&#8217;ll be using the Google Keyword Tool which does a lot of the work for you. Get a list of long tail keywords around a set of 10-20. I know some of you prefers using keywordtracker but I used Google Keyword Tool as its free.</p>

<p>Write 1 article on the topic you have picked. Focused on getting action like Ã¢â‚¬Å“buy this hereÃ¢â‚¬ , Ã¢â‚¬Å“download hereÃ¢â‚¬  or Ã¢â‚¬Å“read more about it hereÃ¢â‚¬ . Now using simple cut and paste method replace the keyword with the next on your lists. Do you get it? Now you have 2 articles with different keywords. Repeat this till all your list are done. Include your affiliate link into your article, if you have your own web host, take some time to create your own landing page with a opt-in list.</p>

<p>Now you need to get a article submitter like <a href="http://javaongsan.bryxen7.hop.clickbank.net/">this Article Submitter Software that will submit your articles to 668 directories</a>. A free version is available too will a limit of 80 directories. This software will assist you to submit your 20 articles to 668 directories. Its normal to get one or 2 sales from 20 articles and with 668 you should manage to close more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Looking back 2007, It was a good year. I have make between $100 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ $300 each month since May. Not too bad for a self taught Internet Marketer. I since been making my living from the Internet. Although, I am not living a luxurious life, this lifestyle allows me to pursuit the things I am interested in like training full time in triathlon and spending more time with my family.</p>

<p>In 2007, I have done a lot of experiment on blogging, though I am not making huge amount of money, I have gain some invaluable insights. I have transit form free blogs to self hosted blog to my own VPS. I personally recommend a dedicated server or at least VPS if you are thinking of making it big. I have also increased my income from 1 site to 5 sites, I believe in multiple streams of income. One of the biggest mistake I did was to remove Adsense completely from my blog after June, since then I lost a good source of income. I tried replacing the space with different network but the results were poor. Before that Adsense was pulling in around $15. Another issue to note was that I abandon Payperpost, simply I felt there was too much competition and it takes too much work. I have replace this income successfully with sponsored reviews, blogvertise and Smorty.</p>

<p>For 2008, I goal is to make my website produce a total income of $10,000 or more by the October. My plan would be to have my income double every month. Starting form January, If I make $500, I double it to $1000 in February, then $2000 in March and so on.</p>

<p>Wishing Every one a happy new year and prosperous year a head. Cheers!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The once popluar Netscape Communicator is coming to an end. After February 1, 2008 there will be no more active product support for Navigator 9, or any previous Netscape Navigator browser. This includes Netscape v1-v4.x, Netscape v6, Netscape v7 Suite, Netscape Browser v8, and Netscape Navigator/Messenger 9.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.netscape.com/2007/12/28/end-of-support-for-netscape-web-browsers">netscape</a>: <em>&#8220;AOL&#8217;s focus on transitioning to an ad-supported web business leaves little room for the size of investment needed to get the Netscape browser to a point many of its fans expect it to be. Given AOL&#8217;s current business focus and the success the Mozilla Foundation has had in developing critically-acclaimed products, we feel it&#8217;s the right time to end development of Netscape branded browsers, hand the reins fully to Mozilla and encourage Netscape users to adopt Firefox.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Now we want to get in touch we our new found friends. As many of you would have found out that most MySpace users accepts your friend invitation but did not visit your profile therefore they would never be able to join your list. Our strategy are based on getting friends, friends join your list, you provide the information they need by your website, after a few follow up some of them will buy. Getting friends on your lists is the next most crucial art after adding friends. By now you should have opt-in form on your profile. If not, you can create an opt-in form with autoresponder like  <a href="http://wizcodersolution.com/recommends/aweber/">aweber</a>.</p>

<p>To get your friends to visit your page you can opt to contact them by private messaging or by bulletin. Form my experience, bulletin gets spam quickly, you not only seeing posting from friends in your network but friends in your friends network. Messaging a hundred of your friends might seem a bit tedious but you can make use of software like <a href="http://www.addnewfriends.com/affiliate/idevaffiliate.php?id=1372">Friend Blaster Pro</a>  to speed up the process. Next we make use of bulletin to get to your extended networks which means we are reaching out to your friend&#8217;s network.<br/>
Make you bulletin message interesting so your extend network will be dawn to your profile. Because bulletin get replace quickly, you can use software to post the same message every hour. Since not all the user are logon at the same time, they will unlikely to see your message if its posted once.</p>

<p>Next we look at a useful tool in MySpace and thats the blog. MySpace behaves like any other blogs, they allow easy blog set up and posting. Html are accepted but not javascript. Comments from other MySpace users are allowed but these can be set to comments from your own network. Using blogs to interest them and using links in your blogs to get them to your webpage is very important. I used a excerpt of my main blog for my space blog. In the end of the post its reads &#8220;to read the full posts go here&#8230;&#8221;. Therefore I am driving traffic to my product blog. At the same time I only allow comments from my friends network forcing other users to add me as their friends in order for them to comment. This is to prevent other marketers from posting their products in the comments, or using comments to drive traffic away. We can also profit from MySpace blog by selling ads space, textlink ads or html ads. You can also make money by applying to paid to blog services like <a href="http://www.smorty.com/?B=3186">Smorty</a>, <a href="http://tinyurl.com/23pnjg">Payperpost</a>, <a href="http://www.sponsoredreviews.com/?aid=2496">Sponsoredreviews</a>, <a href="http://bdv.bidvertiser.com/bidvertiser/referral_button.html?pid=57114">BidVertiser</a>. This little incomes will pay for all those software we are buying and once your marketing take off and you are profiting from your sales of your product, you can opt to stop doing it. Blogs are also highly visible to search engines. That means if you make a new entry on your blog here on MySpace, and you can see how very easy it is to do, it becomes an indexable page on Google and the other big search engines almost immediately. That means you can utilize your knowledge of keyword selection and leverage the blog to get a stronger marketing position on search engines.</p>

<p>One of the crucial ingredient of your MySpace success will be your friends, thats the friends you make or connect to on MySpace. You need to make many friends. You are looking for friends that have interests in your product. One of the biggest mistake most marketer make is a default action in MySpace. Once you have created your account, theres a feature which exists in most social networks that allows you to sent invitations to your friends on your hotmail, yahoo, gmail account. I am going to tell you now &#8220;DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t invite your friends!&#8221;. You can grow your friends list in a few ways. You can browse profile by profile and add each one thats have the same interest. If you are selling motorcycles parts, you will be looking for people who are interested in Motorcycles or who are riding motorcycles. A quick way to find all these people with the same interest is to use MySpace search engine. Under the serach option, select &#8220;General Interest&#8221;. This allows you to find people who have the same interest and have listed them i their profile. You can also used software tools to speed up your friends adding. Software such as <a href="http://www.addnewfriends.com/affiliate/idevaffiliate.php?id=1372">Friend Blaster Pro</a> which helps to target your market based on a members age, sex, geographic location, interests, and more. This software has other features that help you conduct your MySpace business, such as keeping count of how many people you requested that day and the ability to mass-post comments. Build a huge friends lists. Your friend list is the key to succeed in Myspace marketing.</p>

<p>We can further enances your profile to make it look more presentatable. MySpace members have a great deal of control over the appearance and content of their website. They are only limited by their own design skills. If you good at CSS you be able to custom a professional look for your profile. If not you cna google for Ã¢â‚¬Å“myspace resourcesÃ¢â‚¬ , there millions of scripts you can use to improve your layout.</p>

<p>You make  a video of your product providing necessary information. You can also include an self introductory audio of yourself. One of the most important fields in your profile is your interest. This is a searchable field which means myspace users can find people with the same interest using mysapces serach engine, so its important to pick the right keywords for your interest. Myspace search engine does not support long tail keywords so pick single keywords.</p>

<p>Did you check out Myspace&#8217;s forum? Most popular topic is music follow by reglion. How about the classified? What sort of product have you decided? Once you have decide on your product, you need to create a porfile thats suit your products. There several points to note when creating your profile.</p>

<p><strong>Identity</strong><br/>
You creating an identity that synchronize with your product and not you. If you selling woman shoes then you better be female, or if your are selling ring tones then you better be an teenager. You not lying but consider this as an advertisement. Would buy from an 60 year old grandfather who selling antiques? Yes, the profile is consistent with your product.</p>

<p><strong>Picture</strong><br/>
Make sure your picture is consistent with your profile. Just take a little picture with your digital camera or whatever and then use ms paint or your picture editing software and put in your URL at the bottom. Have something in your picture that have your product identity.</p>

<p><strong>Opts-in</strong><br/>
Myspace profile is the only social networking site that allows HTML codes, you create an opt-in from with autoresponder like <a href="http://wizcodersolution.com/recommends/aweber/">aweber</a>.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This  is a series of post on how to use the popular website, MySpace to promote your business and make more money. Why Myspace? As of September 7, 2007, there are over 200 million accounts. While most marketers have move on to facebook, myspace is still getting new sign ups each days so there are still a large untap market.</p>

<p>Do not start making profiles and inviting your friends to join you on myspace, this comes latter. The first step is to do a bit of research on myspace. Look around your city and find people with common interest, find out which are the largest niches. Read their profile, check their blogs. Is there anything that they are looking for or what are the problem they might be facing.</p>

<p>What did your  research tell you about your market?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s my quick and dirty way of starting a internet marketing site for $100 or less.</p>

<p><strong>Domain</strong><br/>
I get my domains from Godaddy, Domain registration for 1 year by Godaddy $9.99</p>

<p><strong>Web Hosting</strong><br/>
I used to host at Godaddy which cost Godaddy 3.99 per month. For a one or two page site there are quite reliable.</p>

<p><strong>Product</strong><br/>
I don&#8217;t create products but I purchase products that sells over time with master resell rights like <a href="http://www.automatedtrafficmachine.com/recommends/fortunewith500">&#8220;Michael Cheney&#8217;s Fortune With 500&#8221;</a> for $37.</p>

<p><strong>Email Autoresponder</strong><br/>
I used aweber for my email campings and follow ups. Its cost about $19.95 per month<br/>
<a href="http://wizcodersolution.com/recommends/aweber/">Sign up for aweber here</a></p>

<p><strong>Generating Traffic</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>I start with free traffic exchange like Trafficswarm. I have found them very effective in generating leads.<br/>
<a href="http://wizcodersolution.com/recommends/trafficswarm/">Sign up for Trafficswarm here</a></p></li>
<li><p>Generate a few links by using textlinkads. Textlinkads is giving away free $100 credits, the cost to activate the free credit is $25.<br/>
<a href="http://wizcodersolution.com/recommends/textlinkads/textlinkads.html">Sign up for textlinkads here</a></p></li>
<li><p>BidVertiser is very similar to Adwords but theres a $20 voucher when you Sign up with this link, to activate your credit card information are needed<br/>
<a href="http://bdv.bidvertiser.com/bidvertiser/referral_button.html?pid=57114">Sign up for BidVertiser here</a></p></li>
</ol>


<p>Once you have first sale you may reinvest in your hosting, autoresponder or your PPC campaign. The sales each month should cover and paid for the services itself. Any access may be used to create a new site, on the new site, you can shared the hosting and autoresponder from the first site, now the cost is lower as they are split between 2 sites. If you keep this going you end up with a lot of sites making a little money each.</p>
