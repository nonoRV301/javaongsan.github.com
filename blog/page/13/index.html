  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&#8217;re outside of North America, Latin America, and Japan, AdSense referrals will be retired. I wonder why?</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re in North America, Latin America, or Japan, the pricing structure for AdSense referrals is changing. Now Adsense no longer will be offering the $5 bonus or $2000 bonus, and the payout for referring a user who generates $100 with AdSense in the first 180 days will return to $100.</p>

<p>These changes will take place during the last week of January.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A referred user who reaches $100 within 180 days of signing up and who removes all payments holds before the change occurs will generate earnings of $250 for the referring publisher.</p></li>
<li><p>Any referred user who meets this conversion criteria after the change occurs will only generate $100 in earnings for the referring publisher. In addition, the $5 bonus will be removed at that time.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Do you make use of AdSense referral? How will this changes affect you?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It seem that Advertlets.com is not folding up after all. Josh Lim here of Advertlets sent out an email explaining the cause.</p>

<p>What happened?<br/>
&#8221;<em>A complication in the renewal process caused the Advertlets.com domain to expire, and caused issues for bloggers with our ads installed, which made their blogs redirect to a placeholder page. It was not our intent to do so. Advertlets.com blog users were unable to login to their Advertlets accounts and access the website as well.</em>&#8221;</p>

<p>Still you need to follow steps listed at http://advertlets.blogspot.com, a site temporarily set up to assist in this issue, or remove your code completely. If you do not remove your code, your blog will be redirected to Advertlets.com.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Kevin Koskella of TriSwimCoach.com posted this interesting article over at <a href="http://www.triathletemag.com/Departments/Training/2007/Developing_the_proper_freestyle_kick.htm">triathletemag.com</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your kick is mainly for stability and body rotation. However, not having a kick or kicking improperly can lead to using twice as much energy to get through your swim! And nobody wants to get on their bike feeling drained and knowing that they still have a lot of work to be done. Let’s address these two challenges and see what can be done to remedy them:</p>

<p>1st Challenge: Having No Kick. While it is important to save your legs and enough energy for biking and running, not kicking will not help you achieve this. You need to develop a kick that works for you. There is no one size fits all with kicking, but it should be relatively rhythmic. In other words, work on developing a 2-beat, 3-beat, or even a 4-beat kick (2, 3, or 4 kicks for every stroke). A good drill to practice this rhythmic kick is 6 Kicks Per Stroke- exaggerating the number of kicks with each rotation.</p>

<p>2nd Challenge: Kicking Improperly. This is a common problem among many triathletes who have “runners’ kick”. What this really means is inflexible ankles, which create drag and force you to do a lot more work than necessary to get through the swim. There are 3 remedies to overcome Runner’s Kick:</p>

<p>1.Vertical Kicking drill. Find water that is deep enough for you to kick in place. Cross your arms, and kick in place in a vertical position (keep in a straight line), pointing your toes and keeping your chin above the surface of the water. Get your power from your quads and hips on this drill. Try 20 seconds at a time.<br/>
Click here for an instructional video</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use fins. Not just to &#8220;keep up&#8221; in workouts, but to actually improve your kick. If you have ankle flexibility issues, use fins for a few weeks, but wean off them as you get closer to your event. The shorter ones are best. I prefer Zoomers, but other brands may work okay as well. Fins can increase your ankle flexibility, allow you to do swimming drills with ease, and strengthen the right leg muscles you need to kick (improving on that 10-15%!)</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch your ankles. You can try sitting on your feet, or, in a seated position, take one leg and bring it out in front of you. Extend your feet and push your toes toward the ground. Hold for about 15-20 seconds, repeat with other foot. You can do this several times a day.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Whatever you do, don&#8217;t be tempted to use a kick board to improve your kick. For distance swimming and triathlons, you are wasting your time with the floatation devices!</p>

<p>Stick with the drills, work on a rhythmic kick, have patience, and you will be pleased with your swimming results!&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finally gotten the email on the much talk about <a href="http://bdv.bidvertiser.com/bidvertiser/referral_button.html?pid=57114">Bidvertiser</a> ads on rss feed. <br/>
Here are the steps to create a new rss feed url with bidvertiser ad: <br/>
1. Login to your publisher account and click &#8220;Add New BidVertiser&#8221;. During the Public Beta, you may also click the &#8220;Public Beta&#8221; link. If you are new to BidVertiser, click here to create a publisher account.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make sure you are under the BidVertiser for your Feed tab.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide your feed URL and title and click Next.</p></li>
<li><p>Verify your feed ownership by adding a temporary post with a unique verification code we provide you with.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose your favorite multiple-subscription Feed Widget and add it to your website or blog. Detail instructions for each of the major blog platforms is provided as part of the process.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The problem now is trying to get all your subscriber to subscribe to your new feed. I certainly not using this, I have been experiencing a sharp decline of rss suscriber. I think its time to kick in another gear and break that 1000 rss count limit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Its seems that Adverlets.com, a local online advertisement network company has shut downed. If you are running adverlets codes, you need to take them down. The code on your webpage will redirect, your page to the Adverlets.com, which now show a free parking page, and states that domain is waiting to be renew. A check on Whois database show that the domain expires on 4 Jan 2008. Now whats happening to the money I have earned?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Did you know you can add articles from other source to your blog to help draw traffic to it? By adding good quality content to your blog, not only can you perform better in organic traffic, you can attract more readers to your site faster. Yes, we are talking about finding keyword articles to boast our traffics.</p>

<p>These keywords can improve the volume and quality of traffic to a web site from search engines via &#8220;natural&#8221; (&#8220;organic&#8221; or &#8220;algorithmic&#8221;) search results. Usually, the higher a site is presented in the search results, the more searchers will visit that site. To scrape articles is easy, you can use free content from article directory, hire a writer, or get it from other blogs. All you need is to give credits to the original author. I suggest you scrape about 30 articles in one go and spread them out in your archives, that means creating this content in past dates. To get index fast you need to submit your new sitemap to <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/">Google Webmaster Central.</a></p>

<p>You be seeing some exciting traffic pretty soon, if you get your keywords right, you can get about 50-100 unique organic traffic per day.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On the first day of 2008, I though we start off the year with a money making tip. Nothing is more effective than the tried and tested article marketing. The first step is Keyword Research. This will helps you find and pick the right keywords for your articles marketing campaign. For this, you&#8217;ll be using the Google Keyword Tool which does a lot of the work for you. Get a list of long tail keywords around a set of 10-20. I know some of you prefers using keywordtracker but I used Google Keyword Tool as its free.</p>

<p>Write 1 article on the topic you have picked. Focused on getting action like Ã¢â‚¬Å“buy this hereÃ¢â‚¬ , Ã¢â‚¬Å“download hereÃ¢â‚¬  or Ã¢â‚¬Å“read more about it hereÃ¢â‚¬ . Now using simple cut and paste method replace the keyword with the next on your lists. Do you get it? Now you have 2 articles with different keywords. Repeat this till all your list are done. Include your affiliate link into your article, if you have your own web host, take some time to create your own landing page with a opt-in list.</p>

<p>Now you need to get a article submitter like <a href="http://javaongsan.bryxen7.hop.clickbank.net/">this Article Submitter Software that will submit your articles to 668 directories</a>. A free version is available too will a limit of 80 directories. This software will assist you to submit your 20 articles to 668 directories. Its normal to get one or 2 sales from 20 articles and with 668 you should manage to close more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Looking back 2007, It was a good year. I have make between $100 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ $300 each month since May. Not too bad for a self taught Internet Marketer. I since been making my living from the Internet. Although, I am not living a luxurious life, this lifestyle allows me to pursuit the things I am interested in like training full time in triathlon and spending more time with my family.</p>

<p>In 2007, I have done a lot of experiment on blogging, though I am not making huge amount of money, I have gain some invaluable insights. I have transit form free blogs to self hosted blog to my own VPS. I personally recommend a dedicated server or at least VPS if you are thinking of making it big. I have also increased my income from 1 site to 5 sites, I believe in multiple streams of income. One of the biggest mistake I did was to remove Adsense completely from my blog after June, since then I lost a good source of income. I tried replacing the space with different network but the results were poor. Before that Adsense was pulling in around $15. Another issue to note was that I abandon Payperpost, simply I felt there was too much competition and it takes too much work. I have replace this income successfully with sponsored reviews, blogvertise and Smorty.</p>

<p>For 2008, I goal is to make my website produce a total income of $10,000 or more by the October. My plan would be to have my income double every month. Starting form January, If I make $500, I double it to $1000 in February, then $2000 in March and so on.</p>

<p>Wishing Every one a happy new year and prosperous year a head. Cheers!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The once popluar Netscape Communicator is coming to an end.

Given AOL&#8217;s current business focus and the success the Mozilla Foundation has had in developing critically-acclaimed products, we feel it&#8217;s the right time to end development of Netscape branded browsers, hand the reins fully to Mozilla and encourage Netscape users to adopt Firefox.&#8221;</em></p>
