  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://localhost:8888/wizcoder/images/c.png" alt="wizcoder" /> Bad news for anyone who is reading is via RSS, I can only push a half feed. This is because a restriction from wordpress, I have not found the plugin to fix this or maybe the new wordpress release will have a full feed feature.</p>

<p>Since July My RSS feed has been hovering around 900 range. I have grew from 0 subscriber to 900 plus from May to July. In July my RSS feed starts decreasing mainly because I was traveling and did not blog for 2, 3 days.</p>

<p><strong>What is an RSS feed?</strong>
An RSS feed is simply an XML formated document of your blog. Most Blog comes with a default RSS feed. RSS is an important promotion tool. Most blog reader used RSS reader like google reader, yahoo, netvibes, blogline etc to track their favorite. RSS reader is an effective tool just like your email client, it announces and collect the latest post form the blog that you subscribed to, therefore save the reader time from having to go back to the actual website.</p>

<p><strong>Feedburner</strong>
Without a method to monetize my feed there really is no reason why I should be bother with my RSS feeds but I love it when my feed count goes up. I have about 9000 subscriber which a lot more than other more popular websites. I used <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">feedburner</a> to track my RSS feed. feedburner is a great service. You should sign up for it if don&#8217;t already have an account. When you burn a feed with feedburner, you get a code to display the number of subscriber you have on your blog.</p>

<p><strong>The secret of increasing from 0 to 900 subscriber in 4 months</strong>
My guess is that you have been reading this post because you want to know the secret. The main technique I used to increase my feed count is content. I post about 4 times a day. Thats it! Bottom line. I have read sometime in February, that he has increased his traffic by posting 4 times a day. I did the same, I did whatever I could, to post 4 times a day. It was tough. I didn&#8217;t know how to write, beside writing programming manual I have no recollection of ever writing some remotely human readable. I have read many blogs very day, tried to copy and modified their styles.</p>

<p>I listed some quick tips for anyone who wants to try this route.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Post more than once. 4 times is good, anything more is a bonus.</p></li>
<li><p>Spread out your posts so user have time to response. I got this from problogger.</p></li>
<li><p>Display a feed count.</p></li>
<li><p>Mix long post with short posts. Long post are pillar articles that you use to anchor your blog. Short post are breaking news, tips, tricks or sharing that require less effort.</p></li>
<li><p>Subscribe to your own feed. Don&#8217;t be the last to know if something is wrong with your feed.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove monetization. The fastest way to grow is a ad free feed.</p></li>
<li><p>Run a contest specially just for your RSS subscriber.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I miss anything else?</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I would like to run a similar contest for RSS subscriber. What type of prize shall it be? I doubt I can get it sponsored so probably be cash. Not sure about the amount. the contest will being once I get the full feed running.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.sxc.hu/pic/m/k/kd/kdelacruz/40951_quick_lunch.jpg" alt="" /> I manage to catch a TV program on how a small business owner create a different for their business among a common niche. When the business owner mention that her customers help out in some of her daily chores, one of the expert shot out that this is a Web 2.0 concept. This really start me thinking about the possibility of using Web 2.0 on a traditional business or have this always been there for small business?</p>

<p>I came from a family that has always run small business. My grandfather ran a farm, a import export type. Every few months pigs and chicken are shipped in and kept on the farm and sold off 1 or 2 months later. My father and his bothers all ran small business, from photo developing, cleaning to raw supplies. In fact, I am the only one who have been a employee for 3 generations. Now I ran a  small software development business now. In traditional business, especially in Asia, its the boss knows best and knows everything, he tells his employee what to do and sometimes the customer as well. Most successful business have come to term that they need input from their customers constantly in order to provide quality service or product. How do we get to that?</p>

<p>Lets take an example of a restaurant. Lets make its specific, its a Chinese, that serves top quality food and have excellence services, highly trained and qualified staffs. The targeted customer are professional and high social status individual, who takes friends and customers for lunch dinners. Strangely, the business is good only on certain days and really bad on certain days. How would you help a business to do well on these days that are not doing well without compromising what the restaurant is already doing.</p>

<p>What we have in web 2.0?
Participation and communication. How do we implement this in an offline world? Feedbacks, yes most restaurant does feedback, but how about putting up comments on a notice board at the entrances or somewhere visible? Contest, how about a cooking contest. Customers takes lesson directly from the chef and serves their own cooking to their friends. Customer reviews. When a new dish is launch, very common in Chinese restaurants, invite a few regulars for food tasting. They will be ask o write a review and display somewhere with their bio and photos.</p>

<p>These are just some ways I have though of. Do you have other uniques ideas? Lets hear it!</p>
