<p>We can further enances your profile to make it look more presentatable. MySpace members have a great deal of control over the appearance and content of their website. They are only limited by their own design skills. If you good at CSS you be able to custom a professional look for your profile. If not you cna google for Ã¢â‚¬Å“myspace resourcesÃ¢â‚¬ , there millions of scripts you can use to improve your layout.</p>

<p>You make  a video of your product providing necessary information. You can also include an self introductory audio of yourself. One of the most important fields in your profile is your interest. This is a searchable field which means myspace users can find people with the same interest using mysapces serach engine, so its important to pick the right keywords for your interest. Myspace search engine does not support long tail keywords so pick single keywords.</p>

<p>Did you check out Myspace&#8217;s forum? Most popular topic is music follow by reglion. How about the classified? What sort of product have you decided? Once you have decide on your product, you need to create a porfile thats suit your products. There several points to note when creating your profile.</p>

<p><strong>Identity</strong><br/>
You creating an identity that synchronize with your product and not you. If you selling woman shoes then you better be female, or if your are selling ring tones then you better be an teenager. You not lying but consider this as an advertisement. Would buy from an 60 year old grandfather who selling antiques? Yes, the profile is consistent with your product.</p>

<p><strong>Picture</strong><br/>
Make sure your picture is consistent with your profile. Just take a little picture with your digital camera or whatever and then use ms paint or your picture editing software and put in your URL at the bottom. Have something in your picture that have your product identity.</p>

<p><strong>Opts-in</strong><br/>
Myspace profile is the only social networking site that allows HTML codes, you create an opt-in from with autoresponder like <a href="http://wizcodersolution.com/recommends/aweber/">aweber</a>.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This  is a series of post on how to use the popular website, MySpace to promote your business and make more money. Why Myspace? As of September 7, 2007, there are over 200 million accounts. While most marketers have move on to facebook, myspace is still getting new sign ups each days so there are still a large untap market.</p>

<p>Do not start making profiles and inviting your friends to join you on myspace, this comes latter. The first step is to do a bit of research on myspace. Look around your city and find people with common interest, find out which are the largest niches. Read their profile, check their blogs. Is there anything that they are looking for or what are the problem they might be facing.</p>

<p>What did your  research tell you about your market?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s my quick and dirty way of starting a internet marketing site for $100 or less.</p>

<p><strong>Domain</strong><br/>
I get my domains from Godaddy, Domain registration for 1 year by Godaddy $9.99</p>

<p><strong>Web Hosting</strong><br/>
I used to host at Godaddy which cost Godaddy 3.99 per month. For a one or two page site there are quite reliable.</p>

<p><strong>Product</strong><br/>
I don&#8217;t create products but I purchase products that sells over time with master resell rights like <a href="http://www.automatedtrafficmachine.com/recommends/fortunewith500">&#8220;Michael Cheney&#8217;s Fortune With 500&#8221;</a> for $37.</p>

<p><strong>Email Autoresponder</strong><br/>
I used aweber for my email campings and follow ups. Its cost about $19.95 per month<br/>
<a href="http://wizcodersolution.com/recommends/aweber/">Sign up for aweber here</a></p>

<p><strong>Generating Traffic</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>I start with free traffic exchange like Trafficswarm. I have found them very effective in generating leads.<br/>
<a href="http://wizcodersolution.com/recommends/trafficswarm/">Sign up for Trafficswarm here</a></p></li>
<li><p>Generate a few links by using textlinkads. Textlinkads is giving away free $100 credits, the cost to activate the free credit is $25.<br/>
<a href="http://wizcodersolution.com/recommends/textlinkads/textlinkads.html">Sign up for textlinkads here</a></p></li>
<li><p>BidVertiser is very similar to Adwords but theres a $20 voucher when you Sign up with this link, to activate your credit card information are needed<br/>
<a href="http://bdv.bidvertiser.com/bidvertiser/referral_button.html?pid=57114">Sign up for BidVertiser here</a></p></li>
</ol>


<p>Once you have first sale you may reinvest in your hosting, autoresponder or your PPC campaign. The sales each month should cover and paid for the services itself. Any access may be used to create a new site, on the new site, you can shared the hosting and autoresponder from the first site, now the cost is lower as they are split between 2 sites. If you keep this going you end up with a lot of sites making a little money each.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://wizcodersolution.com/images/363461_4910.jpg" alt="Blogging and a Balanced Lifestyle" />Many beginning bloggers stays in front of their monitor for more than 18 hours, sacrificing other aspect of their life, hoping to make it big in a short period of time. Well there&#8217;s nothing wrong with having goals, our social life, families and health surfers. When you bitten by that online bug, it&#8217;s extremely difficult to pull yourself away from your computer. I found myself working on my laptop most of the time and every spare moment I have, I push that power button on tiny laptop. Working on new programs, writing new articles, reading emails or simply surfing the internet for information, gives the feeling that I am doing something fruitful and contributing to my goal.</p>

<p>If you fall in this category, you better be single, with no family, friends and not interested in your health. If not, it&#8217;s time to make some changes. Many successful entrepreneurs mention that your success are determine by your daily habits. To be successful, you need to do a few repeated routines each day that propels you towards your long term goal.</p>

<p><strong>Goals</strong><br/>
Goals starts with a dream, that what motivates you to do what ever it takes to achieve it. You are not familiar with setting goals, I suggest you write down a few things at least 25 things that you wanted to accomplish in 5 years time in every aspect of your life, career, family, heath, social, etc. Goals must be precise with a definite date and a measurable unit. Example, if you want to be rich, your goal is NOT &#8220;I want to be rich in future&#8221;. First you did not define future, and you did not define rich, you could end up with a 50 cents more in your pocket when you are 80 years old. A proper statement will be &#8220;I am happy to received $50,000 passive income each month from my blog on 30 Feb 2008&#8221;. Once you have you goal you need to set up a series of daily activities that will help you nail that goal. We call this daily habits, which might be to post 3 times a day, study and research 1 new blog, enroll in a mentoring program like <a href="http://wizcodersolution.com/recommends/blogmastermind/">blogmastermind</a>. These activities should contribute to a monthly goal which adds up to your finally goal. In other words work back from your final goal.</p>

<p>Setting Up A Daily Schedule<br/>
Once you have your daily habits, set a minimum time for each task. This forms up your basic time table. Timetable can be divided into blocks of 2 hours or less, to your preferences. I prefer 2 hours personally, I have attention time spend of 45 minutes or less, preparing each task takes about 5-15 minutes and finishing details about 20 minutes. Once your main block of time is filled, you can now set up time for family, friends and health. Having quality time with your family, playing time with your children, partners, will be the most important and most unpredictables. You may have your kids first school play to attend and you definitely do not want to miss this. You have a anniversary coming up and you may need to plan a dinner which may occupied a block of time allocated for work. In case like these it is good to have a flexible schedule. Keep the basis of your schedule but plan it every week, that allows flexibility and arrangement of unexpected events. The second most important would be health which includes regular exercise, mental/personal development and nutrition.  This simply translate to eat healthy at fixed time, doing some form of exercise at certain time of the day and reading or listening to some form of personal improvement stuffs. Social life is equally important, you want to keep friends and make more, theres no fun being a loner.</p>

<p><img src="http://wizcodersolution.com/images/274258_4678.jpg" alt="Blogging and a Balanced Lifestyle" />Have a clear picture of what you need to achieve each day. Plan wisely make every minute count. Most entrepreneurs utilize every minute to complete a task. We all have the same amount of time each day, the only different is how the sucessful people are utilizing them. Most entrepreneurs wakes up at the same time each morning regardless of when they go to bed. They have a few books or cds in hand, they read in a queue, when traveling, even in the toilet. They do not pick up their phone and they don&#8217;t answer every call. It about how you value your time.</p>

<p>Once you have every aspect of your life plan out, you can true lead a balanced lifestyle thats fun and fulfilling on your journey to your success. Balance is the key to unlocking the door of success. A Journey like this should be traveled along, its always exciting to meet people who heading towards the same destination. So smell the flower once in awhile. It&#8217;s ok to take a break and leave your work desk, it will still be there when you come back but not your family, friends and health.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>The importances of getting to know your reader</strong><br/>
If you have ever tried blogging for money, you will be aware of the importance of choosing the right content for your target audience. Only when your giving your audience what they are looking for, they will will start to trust you and purchase some of the products that you are selling or promoting. To achieve this, you need know your audience, their interests, likes and dislikes. Know your audience and their needs, use this knowledge to help design your blog and write your posts.</p>

<p><strong>Who is your target reader?</strong><br/>
To get to know your readers better, you can start to profile your readers. Set up Google Analytics, Mybloglog, look at comments, email them and study and come up with a way to identified and categories them. You can define such characteristics such as spending power, age, interest etc. With a target reader profile you should find it easier to generate the content that will appeal to them.</p>

<p>When you know what the audience wants and likes, when you know your audience, they become more interested in what you have to say. Often the blogger does not even have to be a good writer, but if the audience feels there is good communication, they will listen and enjoy the post. Knowing the audience can result in the benefits you want.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.sxc.hu/pic/m/m/mr/mrmtfk/554959_15_vespas.jpg" alt="" />Do you really need to blog daily in order to make money? While thats only true if you have 1 miserable blog. What you really need is to change what you been hearing and reading about blogging. This month alone I have blog once a week or less, and my income have been better than when I was doing it daily. Why? This blog simply isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a suitable money maker. When I stopped focusing on just one blog and expanded to 4 blogs. I have more options to play with, doing paid posts, selling links, I could sell bulk links just by spinning out sub domain blogs, sell ad space.</p>

<p>Blog should&#8217;t be the only type of website you create, forums, other portal sites, fan sites, etc are options to explore. The best sites are sites that needs minimal maintenances and have self generated contents, like forums. Expanding is the way to go, till you find that one sites thats pulling in the top income and focus on it solely. Basically, the formula is to create a couple of site, kill the sinking ones keep the good ones, and repeat the process.</p>

<p>Before you go off to work, you will need tools. You need to be able to build website fast and the only way is to customize your very own version of CMS Content Management System. With this customized CMS, it will be plug and play. Within seconds, you have your site site site setup with all the plugin you need and all the ad codes already in place. You may choose to create your cms on your own or engage a programmer to do it for you.</p>

<p>To be profitable,  you always on the look ou, reading analyzing the latest trend, testing, experimenting and fine tuning. That&#8217;s make you an Internet Entrepreneur.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ironman China &amp; Ironman 70.3 China will both take place on April 20, 2008 and will be the first time that a full-distance Ironman and Ironman 70.3 race will be staged at the same venue on the same day. It going to be an awesome event. The event will be at a City of Haikou, the beautiful Hainan Island, known as Asia&#8217;s version of Hawaii.</p>

<p>The Ironman China website (<a href="http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001qMS77ZyDUsQMpVW4Fmi8xc_8tObGb57LFthrhIzRbeD7y0nQOQbODBD8wkAaQlCWQRZaq4a91mJczrFJJaOPJP5XdYVeg5a4zIXR49rrjJBHCZkYAx5yAw==">www.IronmanChina.com</a>)  reports: &#8220;Our venue is world-class in all respects and among the best in the Ironman world&#8221;, said Murphy Reinschreiber, Ironman China&#8217;s Event Director. &#8220;Haikou is a city of 1.7 million people (it would be the 4th largest city in the US) with all the action and opportunities of a major city. Our host hotel, Sheraton Haikou Resort, compares with similar 5-star resort hotels in Hawaii, Phuket, Noosa and other resort destinations.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our bike course is primarily rural, touching the City at the beginning and end of each loop. We expect to use very few cones to separate bikes from cars because bikes will be assigned to entire sides of divided/closed access roads (2+ lanes). There is a section on narrow roads that climbs through two farming villages which will be packed with amazed on-lookers.</p>

<p>The run course includes Haikou&#8217;s version of Alii drive (Bin Hai Avenue), Central Park (Evergreen Park), and the Golden Gate Bridge (New Century Bridge) and then cuts right through the heart of the Old City. It is flat except for the Bridge, palm-shaded in stretches, and interesting to run.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ironmanchina703.com/">Ironman 70.3 China Ironman China<br/>
</a>Ironman 70.3 China will start two hours after Ironman China. The course will be one-loop of Ironman China&#8217;s two-loop swim, bike and run course. Ironman 70.3 China finish line will be adjacent to Ironman China&#8217;s finish line. Both races will share the same post-race facilities and amenities such as massage. The 70.3 awards will be given in front of the Ironman China during the evening.</p>

<p>Ironman 70.3 China offers 25 qualifying slots for the Ford Ironman 70.3 World Championship in Clearwater, Florida, USA in November 2008.</p>

Overall the show is badly produce but still any exposure for the sport is good, or maybe they cut it down for local regions. Anyway you can catch it at 1am tonight and 8am tommorrow morning.</p>
