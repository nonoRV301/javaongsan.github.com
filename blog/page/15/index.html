  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ironman China &amp; Ironman 70.3 China will both take place on April 20, 2008 and will be the first time that a full-distance Ironman and Ironman 70.3 race will be staged at the same venue on the same day. It going to be an awesome event. The event will be at a City of Haikou, the beautiful Hainan Island, known as Asia&#8217;s version of Hawaii.</p>

<p>The Ironman China website (<a href="http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001qMS77ZyDUsQMpVW4Fmi8xc_8tObGb57LFthrhIzRbeD7y0nQOQbODBD8wkAaQlCWQRZaq4a91mJczrFJJaOPJP5XdYVeg5a4zIXR49rrjJBHCZkYAx5yAw==">www.IronmanChina.com</a>)  reports: &#8220;Our venue is world-class in all respects and among the best in the Ironman world&#8221;, said Murphy Reinschreiber, Ironman China&#8217;s Event Director. &#8220;Haikou is a city of 1.7 million people (it would be the 4th largest city in the US) with all the action and opportunities of a major city. Our host hotel, Sheraton Haikou Resort, compares with similar 5-star resort hotels in Hawaii, Phuket, Noosa and other resort destinations.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our bike course is primarily rural, touching the City at the beginning and end of each loop. We expect to use very few cones to separate bikes from cars because bikes will be assigned to entire sides of divided/closed access roads (2+ lanes). There is a section on narrow roads that climbs through two farming villages which will be packed with amazed on-lookers.</p>

<p>The run course includes Haikou&#8217;s version of Alii drive (Bin Hai Avenue), Central Park (Evergreen Park), and the Golden Gate Bridge (New Century Bridge) and then cuts right through the heart of the Old City. It is flat except for the Bridge, palm-shaded in stretches, and interesting to run.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ironmanchina703.com/">Ironman 70.3 China Ironman China<br/>
</a>Ironman 70.3 China will start two hours after Ironman China. The course will be one-loop of Ironman China&#8217;s two-loop swim, bike and run course. Ironman 70.3 China finish line will be adjacent to Ironman China&#8217;s finish line. Both races will share the same post-race facilities and amenities such as massage. The 70.3 awards will be given in front of the Ironman China during the evening.</p>

<p>Ironman 70.3 China offers 25 qualifying slots for the Ford Ironman 70.3 World Championship in Clearwater, Florida, USA in November 2008.</p>

Overall the show is badly produce but still any exposure for the sport is good, or maybe they cut it down for local regions. Anyway you can catch it at 1am tonight and 8am tommorrow morning.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://images.apachefriends.org/images/1240.jpg" alt="" />Xampplite is a cool tool. If you need to work on php and mysql and move your code around work stations, <br/>
xampplite is really a good software to use. Just <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html">Download it</a> <br/>
and  unzip it into your thumb drive at the highest level, <br/>
it must be on the highest level like E: or W:. It will build E:XAMPPlite or W:XAMPPlite or something like this. <br/>
Start xampp by using the control center, xampp-control.exe, start Aapche and mysql using the user friendly interface. <br/>
Start your browser and type http://127.0.0.1 or http://localhost in the location bar. You should see the pre-made<br/>
start page with certain examples and test screens. Stick your usb dive into any computer, start control and run your <br/>
php under Drive:XAMPPlitehtdocstest.php => http://localhost/test.php. You can setup wordpress too. <br/>
Just unzip the installation file under wordpress under htdocs, create database  with phpmyadmin which can<br/>
be found on the default page http://localhost look under the left side bar. <img src="http://www.apachefriends.org/img/linsh1.png" alt="" /><br/>
I have been using Xampp to be build my own fast install version of wordpress. I coded some default values and removed annoying stuff like<br/>
default entries for blogroll. I hack an rss scrapper plugin. The goal is to be able to set up subdomain blog scrappers in a few seconds.<br/>
The whole idea of scrapper is to find backlinks through trackbacks. If you add a like to another post you get a link back just like a comment,<br/>
except trackbacks are 2 way links. If you do the math, you scrape 10 post = 10 links, if you scrape 10 post from 10 blogs you get 100 links, get the point?<br/>
If you throw in some keywords and do an rss search you get few hundred rss links, each have between 10-20 post, you get few hundred links instantly from each blog.<br/>
You can see a sample of my work at <a href="http://www.cappadon.com/">cappadon.com</a>. This a music aggreator site. The plan was to host mtv videos but I couldn&#8217;t<br/>
have time to look for a cms that will do it so for now its just a blog. This a used domain that I bought so I got some backlinks and all the traffic are from organic search engine.<br/>
Its a PR2 as well. Next, I will be working on forums like postnuke and cms like drupal. I will be done <br/>
with my day job next week, after that its back to full time online work.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How&#8217;s your earning this month? October is a good month for me, I have my earning rebounded from $0 back to $166 plus. This month, I am not solely rely on blogging. I have expanded to other areas of making money. There also a lot more opportunities now that I have 3 sites with PRs. I should rewrite my list of money makers and make it more comprehensive. This guide will probably help a few people get up to $100 a month if they have not make money online before.</p>

<p>I have decided to put up as many sites to diversified my incomes. Many eggs in many baskets. The idea is to make money from multiple websites, all with residual incomes by creating websites that are self maintenance or needs very little maintenance needed. This month, I am exploring more area technically which is my strength rather than writing and marketing. I have now own a VPS which makes it easier for me to run scripts and host as many website. The cost is higher in October because of the VPS and a few expired domains. It will be good for this new site to support itself soon.</p>

<p>The coming month, you see less of my post. I have plan a couple of important onces like my research and result from leaving high PR comments, the list of money maker I mentioned and possibly a guide on setting up and using a VPS. This is all I can think of right now. It is going to be a busy  month a head.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apparently the PR update have left my <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/automatedtrafficmachine/">squidoo lens</a> with a PR3. Lately I have been working on my lens a bit keeping it fresh and stay on top 100 on the SEO category. I have converting some old blog post and writing some new ones. I like to see how much I have made form my lens from September onwards. Right now Squidoo only reports up to August earnings. I have also delete away all my other lens so the sole and surviving one looks more creditable. If interested in making money from squidoo, you check out some of my older articles on them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am shopping for a VPS. Anyone has any recommendations? A VPS Virtual Private Servers is the next best thing to a real full pledge server and more affordable. VPS is a virtual sever running on an actual server. One server ca run a few VPSs that why its more affordable. A dedicated server will cost you at least $125 per month while a VPS starts at $15. Why get a VPS? If you need to run programs that are not suitable for shared hosting and cant affordable dedicated server, VPS is a good choice.</p>

<p>I been lurking in forums, picking up reviews on various VPS companies. It seems that the cheaper ones have more support problem. Now it breaks down to how fast before I get my own dedicated server. If I can pull in enough income from the sites that I hosted than  I will go for something cheap but if I need to use the VPS for a while than I rather get something more reliable.</p>

<p>This is some of the VPS providers and cost I have researched, all this fall within my budget. http://www.knownhost.com/services/vps.html $20 cpanel + 7 Fair<br/>
http://www.Zone.net/ $25/month Poor<br/>
http://www.powervps.com/cpanel-vps.php $44.50 per month Good<br/>
http://www.vpsland.com/linuxplans.html $15.99 + 6 Poor<br/>
http://www.jaguarpc.com/vps-hosting/ $19.97 + 7 Fair</p>

<p>Of course, there are things like bandwidth and uptime that I should look at but a this point I probably going with powervps, unless someone have a better suggestion.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am sure anyone that read some of previous know that I currently working. Well thanks to  my comments at some particular blog, I donate every thing I made from this blog away. Not that I am complaining. As describe in my previous post, I was envious of what other people have achieved and I decided to spin of a few more sites. I hope to have a few more  sites with good content foundation. I wanted to have forums, directories, blogs, etc. At least of of each by the end of the year. They don&#8217;t have to make a lot of money, just need to pay off their own hosting. This shouldn&#8217;t be too difficult, I have been making money on free hosted sites already, even my squidoo sites turn in a few cents each month. I am hoping that I will make enough to afford my own server. I purchase a few domain, and mapped out a few strategy, it time to get to work.</p>

<p>Besides web building, I plan to work more on Ruby on rails and PHP. Currently I am not very well versed in them. I am always interested in programming and I doing it mainly as a hobby and not from a business point of view. If  am looking at it as a business man I will be out sourcing. There have been some tools I build with c#, that I like to convert them to PHP. There are also a few PHP source code that I have seen that I would like to convert to c#. I think taking advantage of windows power, I can process more threads at the sametime. Is this right? I am sure, give me a hint.</p>

<p>On a separate note, my maxtor external harddisk can&#8217;t be mount anymore. Looks like theres some bad sector. Theres a lot of data there, 40g of them. Some of my favorite Audios for personal development are all in their. This is the 3rd harddisk that have die on me. I probably can get the data out using an old PC by plucking in the IDE directly. The only problem is where to find one.</p>

<p>I should be quite busy till end of Nov, I am still looking for a few guest blogger who will take over for the period. Everyone is well come. If you want have a go at it, leave me comment, state your interest and I will be in touch.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>PHP and MySQL are the mot used programming tool and database. The primary reason is that they are free and are definitely more stable hosted on a more reliable platform like Unix or Linux. Of course not forgetting the Web Server, the trusty Apache.</p>

<p>If you are going to make money online, at certain time of your career, you need to pick up some programming skills. I don&#8217;t care how many big shot Internet Marketer told you that they made their millions hardly able to move the mouse on their own. To  build an online empire, you need to be able to design and build websites. I remember the first session of WIS was how to use frontpage, I personal feel you need to pick up PHP which is basically the free version of ASP. Although a lot more complex and coding have to done by hand, its will be worth well in the long run. I normally used www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp for references. You might prefer to buy a book or download a tutorial, print it or whatever.</p>

<p>You need to run a server, I recommend using XAMMP. Its a all in one package. Web server, PHP, mysql and many more. Its everything you need to start and its has a windows version so no linux installation is needed. For easier coding, I recommend using Notepad++, a multi language editor, what this does is that it convert PHP in a more readable format.</p>

<p>Learning a program language, should only take 2 hours if you have a good tutorial. Then you need to learn a unique skill which separates the classes of programmers. Debugging. If you are to debug a code you will be able to do anything you want. Good Analytical skills, discipline are required for coding, but no, not everyone turns into a geek. If you feel indifferent and wish to follow all the rest of the world and out source your programming work, getafreelancer and guru.com are good places. There&#8217;s a phrase Microsoft used to say and thats &#8220;PROGRAMMERS RULE THE WORLD!&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.rubyonrails.org/images/rails.png" alt="Ruby On Rails" />Ruby on Rails is a free web application framework that aims to increase the speed and ease with which database-driven web sites can be created and offers skeleton code frameworks (scaffolding) from the outset. Ruby on Rails was created by David Heinemeier Hansson, a Danish.</p>

<p>Ruby on Rails is based on Ruby is a reflective, dynamic, object-oriented programming language. It combines syntax inspired by Perl with Smalltalk-like object-oriented features, and also shares some features with Python, Lisp, Dylan, and CLU. Ruby is a single-pass interpreted language. Its official implementation is free software written in C. The language was created by Yukihiro &#8220;Matz&#8221; Matsumoto, who started working on Ruby on February 24, 1993, and released it to the public in 1995. &#8220;Ruby&#8221; was named as a gemstone because of a joke within Matsumoto&#8217;s circle of friends alluding to Perl&#8217;s name</p>

<p>You are able to develop a web application <em>at least</em> ten times faster with Rails than you can with a typical Java framework. Rails takes full advantage of Ruby, which means you write fewer lines of code to implement your application. Keeping your code small means faster development and fewer bugs, which makes your code easier to understand, maintain, and enhance.</p>

<p>Ruby on Rails have the ability to generate ready to use codes based on your database, which is MySQL most of the time. As a complete framework, its already web 2.0 ready. Whats lacking right now is the hosting for ruby. Most hosting company do not offer Ruby on Rails. Ruby on Rails have more potential as a full web 2.0 than PHP.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have just received my <a href="http://javaongsan.reseller.hop.clickbank.net/">clickbank</a> pay cheque of USD $37. I only cash out because my account had been inactive for a while. I have not been actively promoting affiliate programs and beside I preferred <a href="http://https://www.paypal.com/row/mrb/pal=UJ87DTT6RHYAS">paypal</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Clickbank Payment Basics</strong><br/>
The &#8220;Payment Threshold&#8221; setting in the clickbank account allows you to control when you receive a check. You may select an amount from $10 to $10,000 as your Payment Threshold. The default setting is $100. Your check is hold until your payable balance reaches the amount you select.</p>

<p><strong>Why is my balance decreasing?</strong><br/>
Accounts with a positive balance but no earnings for an extended period of time are considered dormant. Dormant accounts are subject to a charge of $1 per pay period after 90 days of inactivity, $5 per pay period after 180 days of inactivity, and $15 per pay period after 365 days of inactivity.</p>

<p><strong>Bank charges </strong><br/>
Handling commission : 1/8% of cheque amount subject to a minimum ofSGD10.00 and maximum of SGD100.00 Plus postage charge of SGD4.00<br/>
Overseas agent bank charge (differs, depending on the currency type andamount) USD5.00.<br/>
Thats a lot of money wasted and I have wait 3-4weeks.</p>

<p><a href="http://javaongsan.reseller.hop.clickbank.net">Referral Program</a><br/>
The only product I wish to promote is the <a href="http://javaongsan.reseller.hop.clickbank.net">Referral Program</a>.<br/>
Clickbank  standard activation charge is $49.95, and you keep 20% of that, so you earn $9.99 up front.</p>

<p>Clickbank  typical markup is $1 + 7.5%, and you keep 5% of that, so you earn about $0.09 to $0.99 on every sale.</p>

<p>$10     sale     =     $0.09 commission<br/>
$20     sale     =     $0.13 commission<br/>
$30     sale     =     $0.16 commission<br/>
$40     sale     =     $0.20 commission<br/>
$50     sale     =     $0.24 commission<br/>
