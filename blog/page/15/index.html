  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am sure anyone that read some of previous know that I currently working. Well thanks to  my comments at some particular blog, I donate every thing I made from this blog away. Not that I am complaining. As describe in my previous post, I was envious of what other people have achieved and I decided to spin of a few more sites. I hope to have a few more  sites with good content foundation. I wanted to have forums, directories, blogs, etc. At least of of each by the end of the year. They don&#8217;t have to make a lot of money, just need to pay off their own hosting. This shouldn&#8217;t be too difficult, I have been making money on free hosted sites already, even my squidoo sites turn in a few cents each month. I am hoping that I will make enough to afford my own server. I purchase a few domain, and mapped out a few strategy, it time to get to work.</p>

<p>Besides web building, I plan to work more on Ruby on rails and PHP. Currently I am not very well versed in them. I am always interested in programming and I doing it mainly as a hobby and not from a business point of view. If  am looking at it as a business man I will be out sourcing. There have been some tools I build with c#, that I like to convert them to PHP. There are also a few PHP source code that I have seen that I would like to convert to c#. I think taking advantage of windows power, I can process more threads at the sametime. Is this right? I am sure, give me a hint.</p>

<p>On a separate note, my maxtor external harddisk can&#8217;t be mount anymore. Looks like theres some bad sector. Theres a lot of data there, 40g of them. Some of my favorite Audios for personal development are all in their. This is the 3rd harddisk that have die on me. I probably can get the data out using an old PC by plucking in the IDE directly. The only problem is where to find one.</p>

<p>I should be quite busy till end of Nov, I am still looking for a few guest blogger who will take over for the period. Everyone is well come. If you want have a go at it, leave me comment, state your interest and I will be in touch.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>PHP and MySQL are the mot used programming tool and database. The primary reason is that they are free and are definitely more stable hosted on a more reliable platform like Unix or Linux. Of course not forgetting the Web Server, the trusty Apache.</p>

<p>If you are going to make money online, at certain time of your career, you need to pick up some programming skills. I don&#8217;t care how many big shot Internet Marketer told you that they made their millions hardly able to move the mouse on their own. To  build an online empire, you need to be able to design and build websites. I remember the first session of WIS was how to use frontpage, I personal feel you need to pick up PHP which is basically the free version of ASP. Although a lot more complex and coding have to done by hand, its will be worth well in the long run. I normally used www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp for references. You might prefer to buy a book or download a tutorial, print it or whatever.</p>

<p>You need to run a server, I recommend using XAMMP. Its a all in one package. Web server, PHP, mysql and many more. Its everything you need to start and its has a windows version so no linux installation is needed. For easier coding, I recommend using Notepad++, a multi language editor, what this does is that it convert PHP in a more readable format.</p>

<p>Learning a program language, should only take 2 hours if you have a good tutorial. Then you need to learn a unique skill which separates the classes of programmers. Debugging. If you are to debug a code you will be able to do anything you want. Good Analytical skills, discipline are required for coding, but no, not everyone turns into a geek. If you feel indifferent and wish to follow all the rest of the world and out source your programming work, getafreelancer and guru.com are good places. There&#8217;s a phrase Microsoft used to say and thats &#8220;PROGRAMMERS RULE THE WORLD!&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.rubyonrails.org/images/rails.png" alt="Ruby On Rails" />Ruby on Rails is a free web application framework that aims to increase the speed and ease with which database-driven web sites can be created and offers skeleton code frameworks (scaffolding) from the outset. Ruby on Rails was created by David Heinemeier Hansson, a Danish.</p>

<p>Ruby on Rails is based on Ruby is a reflective, dynamic, object-oriented programming language. It combines syntax inspired by Perl with Smalltalk-like object-oriented features, and also shares some features with Python, Lisp, Dylan, and CLU. Ruby is a single-pass interpreted language. Its official implementation is free software written in C. The language was created by Yukihiro &#8220;Matz&#8221; Matsumoto, who started working on Ruby on February 24, 1993, and released it to the public in 1995. &#8220;Ruby&#8221; was named as a gemstone because of a joke within Matsumoto&#8217;s circle of friends alluding to Perl&#8217;s name</p>

<p>You are able to develop a web application <em>at least</em> ten times faster with Rails than you can with a typical Java framework. Rails takes full advantage of Ruby, which means you write fewer lines of code to implement your application. Keeping your code small means faster development and fewer bugs, which makes your code easier to understand, maintain, and enhance.</p>

<p>Ruby on Rails have the ability to generate ready to use codes based on your database, which is MySQL most of the time. As a complete framework, its already web 2.0 ready. Whats lacking right now is the hosting for ruby. Most hosting company do not offer Ruby on Rails. Ruby on Rails have more potential as a full web 2.0 than PHP.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have just received my <a href="http://javaongsan.reseller.hop.clickbank.net/">clickbank</a> pay cheque of USD $37. I only cash out because my account had been inactive for a while. I have not been actively promoting affiliate programs and beside I preferred <a href="http://https://www.paypal.com/row/mrb/pal=UJ87DTT6RHYAS">paypal</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Clickbank Payment Basics</strong><br/>
The &#8220;Payment Threshold&#8221; setting in the clickbank account allows you to control when you receive a check. You may select an amount from $10 to $10,000 as your Payment Threshold. The default setting is $100. Your check is hold until your payable balance reaches the amount you select.</p>

<p><strong>Why is my balance decreasing?</strong><br/>
Accounts with a positive balance but no earnings for an extended period of time are considered dormant. Dormant accounts are subject to a charge of $1 per pay period after 90 days of inactivity, $5 per pay period after 180 days of inactivity, and $15 per pay period after 365 days of inactivity.</p>

<p><strong>Bank charges </strong><br/>
Handling commission : 1/8% of cheque amount subject to a minimum ofSGD10.00 and maximum of SGD100.00 Plus postage charge of SGD4.00<br/>
Overseas agent bank charge (differs, depending on the currency type andamount) USD5.00.<br/>
Thats a lot of money wasted and I have wait 3-4weeks.</p>

<p><a href="http://javaongsan.reseller.hop.clickbank.net">Referral Program</a><br/>
The only product I wish to promote is the <a href="http://javaongsan.reseller.hop.clickbank.net">Referral Program</a>.<br/>
Clickbank  standard activation charge is $49.95, and you keep 20% of that, so you earn $9.99 up front.</p>

<p>Clickbank  typical markup is $1 + 7.5%, and you keep 5% of that, so you earn about $0.09 to $0.99 on every sale.</p>

<p>$10     sale     =     $0.09 commission<br/>
$20     sale     =     $0.13 commission<br/>
$30     sale     =     $0.16 commission<br/>
$40     sale     =     $0.20 commission<br/>
$50     sale     =     $0.24 commission<br/>
$100     sale     =     $0.42 commission<br/>
$150     sale     =     $0.61 commission<br/>
$200     sale     =     $0.80 commission<br/>
$250     sale     =     $0.99 commission</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://wizcodersolution.com/images/c.png" alt="wizcoder" /> Bad news for anyone who is reading is via RSS, I can only push a half feed. This is because a restriction from wordpress, I have not found the plugin to fix this or maybe the new wordpress release will have a full feed feature.</p>

<p>Since July My RSS feed has been hovering around 900 range. I have grew from 0 subscriber to 900 plus from May to July. In July my RSS feed starts decreasing mainly because I was traveling and did not blog for 2, 3 days.</p>

<p><strong>What is an RSS feed?</strong><br/>
An RSS feed is simply an XML formated document of your blog. Most Blog comes with a default RSS feed. RSS is an important promotion tool. Most blog reader used RSS reader like google reader, yahoo, netvibes, blogline etc to track their favorite. RSS reader is an effective tool just like your email client, it announces and collect the latest post form the blog that you subscribed to, therefore save the reader time from having to go back to the actual website.</p>

<p><strong>Feedburner</strong><br/>
Without a method to monetize my feed there really is no reason why I should be bother with my RSS feeds but I love it when my feed count goes up. I have about 9000 subscriber which a lot more than other more popular websites. I used <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">feedburner</a> to track my RSS feed. feedburner is a great service. You should sign up for it if don&#8217;t already have an account. When you burn a feed with feedburner, you get a code to display the number of subscriber you have on your blog.</p>

<p><strong>The secret of increasing from 0 to 900 subscriber in 4 months</strong><br/>
My guess is that you have been reading this post because you want to know the secret. The main technique I used to increase my feed count is content. I post about 4 times a day. Thats it! Bottom line. I have read sometime in February, that he has increased his traffic by posting 4 times a day. I did the same, I did whatever I could, to post 4 times a day. It was tough. I didn&#8217;t know how to write, beside writing programming manual I have no recollection of ever writing some remotely human readable. I have read many blogs very day, tried to copy and modified their styles.</p>

<p>I listed some quick tips for anyone who wants to try this route.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Post more than once. 4 times is good, anything more is a bonus.</p></li>
<li><p>Spread out your posts so user have time to response. I got this from problogger.</p></li>
<li><p>Display a feed count.</p></li>
<li><p>Mix long post with short posts. Long post are pillar articles that you use to anchor your blog. Short post are breaking news, tips, tricks or sharing that require less effort.</p></li>
<li><p>Subscribe to your own feed. Don&#8217;t be the last to know if something is wrong with your feed.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove monetization. The fastest way to grow is a ad free feed.</p></li>
<li><p>Run a contest specially just for your RSS subscriber.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I miss anything else?</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I would like to run a similar contest for RSS subscriber. What type of prize shall it be? I doubt I can get it sponsored so probably be cash. Not sure about the amount. the contest will being once I get the full feed running.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.sxc.hu/pic/m/k/kd/kdelacruz/40951_quick_lunch.jpg" alt="wizcodersolution.com" />I manage to catch a TV program on how a small business owner create a different for their business among a common niche. When the business owner mention that her customers help out in some of her daily chores, one of the expert shot out that this is a Web 2.0 concept. This really start me thinking about the possibility of using Web 2.0 on a traditional business or have this always been there for small business?</p>

<p>I came from a family that has always run small business. My grandfather ran a farm, a import export type. Every few months pigs and chicken are shipped in and kept on the farm and sold off 1 or 2 months later. My father and his bothers all ran small business, from photo developing, cleaning to raw supplies. In fact, I am the only one who have been a employee for 3 generations. Now I ran a  small software development business now. In traditional business, especially in Asia, its the boss knows best and knows everything, he tells his employee what to do and sometimes the customer as well. Most successful business have come to term that they need input from their customers constantly in order to provide quality service or product. How do we get to that?</p>

<p>Lets take an example of a restaurant. Lets make its specific, its a Chinese, that serves top quality food and have excellence services, highly trained and qualified staffs. The targeted customer are professional and high social status individual, who takes friends and customers for lunch dinners. Strangely, the business is good only on certain days and really bad on certain days. How would you help a business to do well on these days that are not doing well without compromising what the restaurant is already doing.</p>

<p>What we have in web 2.0?<br/>
Participation and communication. How do we implement this in an offline world? Feedbacks, yes most restaurant does feedback, but how about putting up comments on a notice board at the entrances or somewhere visible? Contest, how about a cooking contest. Customers takes lesson directly from the chef and serves their own cooking to their friends. Customer reviews. When a new dish is launch, very common in Chinese restaurants, invite a few regulars for food tasting. They will be ask o write a review and display somewhere with their bio and photos.</p>

<p>These are just some ways I have though of. Do you have other uniques ideas? Lets hear it!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/38117000/gif/_38117682_front_crawl_turn.gif" alt="" />This is possible coolest trick for a triathlete. It makes us look more pro, cool and its a lot of fun. I have only master tumble and working on the turn. Not bad for someone who is only swimming his second year.</p>

<p>How the tumble turn is done.<br/>
When almost reaching the wall forward somersault just before the wall. Body facing up, both feet planted on the wall, knees bent, hands overhead, stretched out. Push off with you feet. Twist your body back to front crawl position.</p>

<p>Breaking it up.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Somersault - Learn to somersault in the water. Breathe out and perform the somersault. Ending position facing up</p></li>
<li><p>Somersault and push-off on back - When you comfortable in the water, add the wall push off.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the turn - Now you need to know how to twist the body back to the front.</p></li>
<li><p>Put it all together - OK when you ready to put it all together.
Well there&#8217;s not correct way for the tumble turn, what we want to achieve is minimizing time touch the wall and pushing off the wall with ours hands and hopefully shed a few seconds off our practice swims.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you own a website that sent out newsletter, a sales page that captures customers detail or a blog that provides email subscriptions, you need a form that captures what ever information that you need and stores it in your databases. You can have it program and ran it off your SMTP mail server of your host or you can purchase an account from a 3rd party service provider. The advantage of using a 3rd party services is when your server is down, your autoresponders are still running. This also reduce the percentage of your email be treated as spam because your using a different domain name as part of email. There several bands of email autoresponder, I tried a few and picked <a href="http://automatedtrafficmachine.com/aweber">AWeber</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>MyBloglog was under maintenances this morning and now the yahooid integration is completed. When you log on you be redirected to a yahoo login. There is a second step where you are required to key in you Mybloglog id and password inorder for the integration. The funny thing is that my photo was replace by a older version. I spent alot of time on MyBlogLog is a good place to check the current popular blogs.</p>

<p>Another great improvement is that the widget for MyBlogLog can now be customize using css scripts.</p>
