  <div class="entry-content"><p>Earning continues to fall. One of the reason is losing he PR1 status. The number of rss subscribe have dropped by 100+- in August the only drop and the highest since rss subscribing start gaining speed in May. It was increasing 10-20 daily. Still the downfall was lack of communication to the readers, judging from the number of comments  left. This month I will report any income that has make at least 10 dollars. I will not use table format anymore, blogger have a habit of distorting my tables. <a href="http://tinyurl.com/23pnjg"> payperpost</a>- $11. Surprisingly this is all I made this month.</p>

<p>I am experimenting with a few new ads network, 2 of which is local. Till my PR increase , I will be doing another <a href="http://tinyurl.com/23pnjg"> payperpost</a>. I have plans to migrate my blog out of blogger, a large part of my archives, which are useless will be deleted.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have you wander if your blogger blog can be sold? How much can it sell for? We all know that blogs can be sold but thats mostly self-hosted wordpress. First of all Why would anyone buy something thats created for free? Traffic? PR Rank? Lots of original contents? One criteria  would be the monthly income of that blog. Or maybe the blog&#8217;s potential when monetized. Will you sell your blog if the price is right?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In an attempt to savage my blog earning, I will try out several others money making opportunities. One which I have sing up but have not take part in, is “Advertlets”. Advertlets is similar to other Ad networks except that it is started by a Malaysian company. Josh Lim is the technopreneur behind Advertlets, he runs Josh Lim &amp; Associates. Bloggers make money by selling advertising space on their blogs.  It&#8217;s style is heavily localise with lots of local Malaysia and Singapore slangs. Advertlets targets at blogger and advertisers from Singapore and Malaysia. This done in-order for local advertisers get to connect their message to the right audience.</p>

<p>Adverlets requirements are simple. To qualify, you must be at least 16 years old. There are no traffic requirements. Your blog must also not contain any inflammatory or illegal content. Currently they are running a “SGD 8800 for 300 Singaporean Bloggers” promotion. The detail are  not well described but they are giving away $25 for any Singaporean blogger who join and write a post about them.</p>

<p>Advertlets Compared With Other Online Advertising Services and Suggestions On How Advertlets Can Improve Further.<br/>
If you look closely, Adverlets is a pretty new company and this system is in beta. Looking around the system, is tough even for a experience user. Its takes a wile to dig out the company history. I spent somtime looking for codes and your affiliates links. Apparently there are no textlink affiliate links only plug in javascript. I will definitely loose quite a bit of referrals, and I do not know if there are benefits for referrals. My preferred method of payment paypal is not included, payment are sent by old fashion cheques.</p>

<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_VgnX_0XbCps/RsfVTEaYF9I/AAAAAAAAAD4/jqaTAImXnSI/s1600-h/Ad.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_VgnX_0XbCps/RsfVTEaYF9I/AAAAAAAAAD4/jqaTAImXnSI/s200/Ad.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>If you are either from Malaysia or Singapore, Adverlets might just work for you, but then don&#8217;t put all your eggs in one baskets. This is just one of the small basket that you can try out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Google PR update happen recently. I notice a few of the site I visited drop in their PR. A number of blog have PR reduce to o or nothing. My blog PR went from 3 to 1 to nothing. I believe that the algorithm have been updated, they always do,  but then we will not know what was updated. I hope that some day I be able to see the codes behind the search engine.</p>

<p>PageRank Explained (extract from <a href="http://www.google.com/technology/">http://www.google.com/technology/</a>)<br/>
PageRank relies on the uniquely democratic nature of the web by using its vast link structure as an indicator of an individual page&#8217;s value. In essence, Google interprets a link from page A to page B as a vote, by page A, for page B. But, Google looks at considerably more than the sheer volume of votes, or links a page receives; for example, it also analyzes the page that casts the vote. Votes cast by pages that are themselves &#8220;important&#8221; weigh more heavily and help to make other pages &#8220;important.&#8221; Using these and other factors, Google provides its views on pages&#8217; relative importance.</p>

<p>Of course, important pages mean nothing to you if they don&#8217;t match your query. So, Google combines PageRank with sophisticated text-matching techniques to find pages that are both important and relevant to your search. Google goes far beyond the number of times a term appears on a page and examines dozens of aspects of the page&#8217;s content (and the content of the pages linking to it) to determine if it&#8217;s a good match for your query.</p>

<p>My link build wasn&#8217;t intensive, and using link exchange sites doesn&#8217;t help either.  To get better Pr you need to be link by sites that have quality content, higher PR than yours and of the same topic. If I am a normal web master I would not be bother by page rank updates, however if you are involved in Paid Post program like <a href="http://tinyurl.com/23pnjg">Payperpost</a> you need higher PR to get paid better. Most of these program uses Google PR and Alexa ranking as bench marks. Alexa is is measurement of your blog from user who have a Alexa toolbar plug-in on their browser when they surf your sites. The measurement  are inaccurate  and difficult to improve on, many web site owner do not include Alexa as a gauge of their site traffic. Google PR is more accurate but harder to archive, the only thing that is made know is to improve the content of your site and the backlinks form  quality sites.</p>

<p>As my page rank comes down, blogging for services like <a href="http://tinyurl.com/23pnjg">Payperpost</a> becomes harder. Using ad networks is not a good solution with a site that has only less than 200 page views a day. I would be looking for a better way to make money from my blog.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On the topic of updating your content more than once per day, many blogger state time and resources as the main obstacle to posting more than once a day. There are several ways to overcome time restraint.</p>

<p>Preparing your all your content beforehand<br/>
Type all your post on notepad or your chose of application or simply save a draft copy on your blogging platform. When its time to release them, you can log in to post them or you can set up email posting. Several blog platform allow email posting. You can also schedule your email with some email services. This way everything is automated.</p>

<p>Using Guest Bloggers<br/>
My prefer method to getting more content per day. Too bad I have not found anyone who are willing to guest post for my blog. Using guest blogger takes the workload off you and let reader experience different style of blogging. Guest blogger can be given a account which they can post freely at any given time slot or they simply submit articles to you directly. This is especial useful if you are going away for a while and have no access to internet. Having someone manning your blog while you away keeps your blog activities and your mind at ease.</p>

<p>Hiring a someone to do it<br/>
If are willing you can pay some one to blog for as little as $1 per article. Such blogger can be found on sites like getafreelancer.com or any other source. The advantage of this method is the variety of writter you will get, the down site is that you have to ay them.</p>

<p>Whichever method you choose updating you content regularly is critical for your blog.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some of the very common questions in blogging are:</p>

<ol>
<li>How to get traffic to my blog?</li>
<li>How often should I post?</li>
<li>when should I ping my blog?
Somehow all this question are directly or indirectly related to your blog traffic. What you writing and the frequency of your posting affects your traffic, whether you need to ping your blog. If you post once a day, your traffic is pretty much stable and if your articles are good, you have a steady base of readers. Google indexes your blog fast. If you are posting more than once a day, with some allowances apart, your blog will be mark to be index faster than someone who does it once in a few days.</li>
</ol>


<p>If you have already burn your feed with feedburner, you be able to set up pingautomatic there too. Once you ave post feedburner pings your blog to a wide variety of rss readers. If your blog is new or if you do not update them regularly you need to ping it manually after each post.</p>

<p>To get more traffic to your blog, a simple solution is to post more than once a day. If you are able to post 4 times a day, you get a short charge of traffic instantly. Blog regularly and you get all the traffic you need.</p>
