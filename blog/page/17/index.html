  <div class="entry-content"><p>Feedburner Count<br/>
Nobody reads a blog that has low feed count. Here&#8217;s a quick fix.<br/>
Inflate your feedburner counter with photoshop. Like this <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Efc/Techcrunch?bg=FF6600&amp;fg=000000&amp;anim=0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Efc/Techcrunch?bg=FF6600&amp;fg=000000&amp;anim=0" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Inflate your feedburner count by suscribing to your own feed&#8230;a few thousand times. Google reader allows user to subscribe to rss feed more than once. You do it 10,000 times.</p>

<p>Comments<br/>
Be a resident commenter. Comment on every post and reply your own comment, basically you are commenting multiple times on the same post. The point is you are trying to be a pest. A good spam comment software really helps to ease the work load. Do this until you get ban.</p>

<p>Self Commentary<br/>
Not getting attention from top blogger in your niche? Here&#8217;s an very evil way to get attention from top bloggers. We all know you can post comment on other blogs but how about commenting for others on your own blog.</p>

<p>What you need? Name, Email, Blog URL. All these can be found on the targeted blog. Now put in a comment for all your favorite top bloggers, using their credentials. Put in something &#8220;This is an awesome post, I been watching you for a well, I think your are the best blogger around!&#8221;. Then go to the blogger that you have commented for and leave a comment &#8220;Thanks for coming by, I didn&#8217;t know you like my blog that much&#8221;. Do this with 20 top bloggers and you create an instant buzz to your blog and grad some attention that you been long craving for.</p>

<p>Warning: Results may varies from blog to blog. Consequences are fatal. Final advice don&#8217;t try this!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Basic SEO advice for Beginners. While these may not guarantee top placement for you website in any search engines, hopefully it will increase your chances of having indexed by them.</p>

<p>Keywords<br/>
The first step the most crucial, ask yourself &#8220;how do you want to be found?&#8221;. What do you want users to types in and for your site to show up. You can&#8217;t be found for every single keyword that they type in so you have to choose one word or a phrase that represents your site.</p>

<p>Some rules to abide by when deciding on keywords</p>

<ul>
<li>Choose a keyword that everybody are looking for</li>
<li>Do not choose a keyword that is unrelated to your website</li>
<li>Use a keyword that is relevant to your content.
Header and Title<br/>
Use keywords to from up part of your header text and titles.</li>
</ul>


<p>Meta Description and Meta Keywords are overrated so forget them.</p>

<p>Content<br/>
The content should contain the keywords right at the beginning of the page. Do not overuse keywords.<br/>
There&#8217;s no need to bother about submission to search engines, creating robot.txt or sitemaps. These are waste of time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Web designer, developer and coder pride themselves as Gog of the Internet, creator of things digital. They design website that uses the latest technology, fancy scripts, colorful moving objects, out-of-the-world flash but they can made a single cent on the web and THATS THE TRUE! How do I know? I have been a coder and have work the Internet for over 10 years and till recenlty I wasn&#8217;t making any money for myself or my clients. I list out the most common mistake a professional web designer are mostly to made.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Using Flash Template as a  website.</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>If you still living in 1990s, this is  fine but Web 2.0 are already here, so wake up and smell the digital  coffee. Flash templates are not interactive and they will never be.  They are just artistic piece of art that moves around on the web.  When you need a web designer, always ask for a PHP (a open source  software which means this tool is free) programmer who knows web  design and not a web designer who can build a website.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Using Flash on your website.</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>I have nothing against flash but even a tiny little flash program running on your web page can cause the amount of loading time your entire web page add together. Let me put it this way, “Flash is not cash”.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Using too many colours.</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>A basic website should only use a maximum of 4 colors. Background, Text, Link are most common identified color areas. There&#8217;s no need to be colorful, just think of a book, amgazine or newspaper you read recently, what the color of the text and whats the color of the background.</p>

<p><strong>Using Dark Background.</strong></p>

<p>The dark background are used a lot by hacker sites back in the 80s. White text on Black background may look really cool, it does not work for a normal website that is looking to attract consistent readers.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Using too many scripts.</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>Scripts like javascript, ajax, vbscript are common on web page to perform task that uses recourse from client machine and to take the load of the server. However too many scripts too will slow the whole web page down. You would want to remove fancy scripts that does not i any way benefit the user.</p>

<p><strong>The cute redirection.</strong></p>

<p>One of the worst script around is the redirection javascript. If you are using one, I beg you, please remove it. This script says “Please wait while we redirects you in a few seconds”. What happen if its does not work? This script will sent most of your visitor away before your script finish loading your site.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Inconsistent navigation style.</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>What can be worse than not able to find the link that you need? So many website uses fancy menu that pop in and out, and some will not stand still long enough for my mouse to click on them.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Fonts are too big or too small.</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>The font fraorite by designers and coder are a little smaller than what mormal web surfer prefer. We used to smaller fonts to see more codes and we use too it. We used fonts like courier that no one likes.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Not providing help or FAQ for  users.</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>Most designer will design the website but they will not take time to put in a help or faq on how to used the site, especially f its a community or forum. Even of a experience user it takes time to know what the website is trying to do and how to perform the action we want.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Everyone is talking about facebook recently, I am getting so much news and question from my friends(offlines) on facebook. Facebook is founded and created by Mark Zuckerberg a 23 year old Harvard dropout (ironically he was influenced by another famous Harvard dropout “to go out and make something happen”).</p>

<p><em><strong>History of Facebook</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>February 2004</strong>, Thefacebook.com, as it was originally called, was launched. Within two weeks, half the Harvard student body had signed up.<br/>
<strong>September 2005</strong>, Facebook opened up to high school students.<br/>
<strong>October 2005</strong>,  Facebook added a photo feature, and technical demands skyrocketed.<br/>
<strong>June 2006</strong>, the site was opened to work networks. There are more than 20,000 networks of employees, from major corporation and US government agency. Even MySpace has a corporate network of 22 employees.<br/>
<strong>September 2006</strong>, Facebook opens up to anyone with a valid email address.</p>

<p><a href="http://images.fastcompany.com/magazine/115/facebook1.jpg"><img src="http://images.fastcompany.com/magazine/115/facebook1.jpg" alt="" /></a><br/>
<strong>The Hacker</strong><br/>
<strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong> wanted to build an online student directory with photos and basic information, known at most schools as a face book. The school rejected the idea so Mark went ahead, he hacked into Harvard&#8217;s student records and created “Facemash”. This site has an algorithm that randomly paired photos of undergraduates and invited visitors to determine which one was &#8220;hotter&#8221;. The hack lasted only 4 hours, before Harvard step in. In 4 hours, the site managed to attract 450 visitors.  A revamp of approach and Mark set up the Facebook template that allows students fill in their own information. He spent most of his time o the new project instead of going to school. 2 days before art history final, he needed to be able to discuss 500 images from the Augustan period. Like a true hacker, he built a website with one image per page and a place for comments, invites his classmates to share their notes. Within two hours, all the images were populated with notes. Thats how you get homework done on Facebook! (extracted from <a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.fastcompany.com/magazine/115/open_features-hacker-dropout-ceo.html">fastcompany</a>)</p>

<p><strong>The Website</strong><br/>
If you have not being on Facebook, its very different from other social networking sites. If you use a work or school email address to register, you are auto-connect with coworkers or classmates.</p>

<p>Privacy is better than any othe sites I have been on. At Facebook, people should have control over how they share their information and who can see it. People can only see the profiles of confirmed friends and the people in their networks. You can use our privacy settings at any time to control who can see what on Facebook. Facebook has lots of ulities that make the platform so attractive. A unqiue feature such as sending message to email addresses from facebook. No more switching back and forth between email and Facebook. When you are writing a message, simply enter any emails you like into the “To:” field. They made Facebook accessable for iPhone or any other mobile browser. iPhone user access    iphone.facebook.com. Other devices go to m.facebook.com.<br/>
<a href="http://photos-c.ak.facebook.com/photos-ak-sctm/v124/75/57/500031439/a500031439_259470_411.jpg"><img src="http://photos-c.ak.facebook.com/photos-ak-sctm/v124/75/57/500031439/a500031439_259470_411.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>There are many other cool stuff you can do with Facebook. Get rid o your old stuff, product or buy something at the Facebook Markeplace. Write something, add video or shared items on your or your friend&#8217;s Wall. Join a group, you can join up to 200 groups.</p>

<p>Developers<br/>
Facebook is build on PHP and Mysql, both open source softwares, which makes it more stable and extendable. To allow other developers to work on Facebook, Facebook Platform wass luanched, it is a standards-based web service with methods for accessing and contributing Facebook data. Facebook Platform is Facebook&#8217;s initiative to allow developers from around the world to build new applications for the site. Check out the <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/documentation.php?v=1.0">API Documentation</a> for supported functions and examples. Sign up for an <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/account.php">API Key</a>. To date, there are over 2500 applications available, and growing.</p>

<p>However not all applications are weclome, Techcruch wrote a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/09/06/facebook-opening-up-but-on-its-own-terms/">story</a> about a independent programmer who ran into a bit of trouble with <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/facebook">Facebook</a> over a snippet of code he developed and published that allowed users to update their Facebook status without visiting the site.</p>

<p>Ready for Facebook, all you needed to join is a valid email address. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=630480292">Check out my Facebook profile here</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Earning continues to fall. One of the reason is losing he PR1 status. The number of rss subscribe have dropped by 100+- in August the only drop and the highest since rss subscribing start gaining speed in May. It was increasing 10-20 daily. Still the downfall was lack of communication to the readers, judging from the number of comments  left. This month I will report any income that has make at least 10 dollars. I will not use table format anymore, blogger have a habit of distorting my tables. <a href="http://tinyurl.com/23pnjg"> payperpost</a>- $11. Surprisingly this is all I made this month.</p>

<p>I am experimenting with a few new ads network, 2 of which is local. Till my PR increase , I will be doing another <a href="http://tinyurl.com/23pnjg"> payperpost</a>. I have plans to migrate my blog out of blogger, a large part of my archives, which are useless will be deleted.</p>
