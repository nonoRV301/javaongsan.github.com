The problem a blog can have high PR on its main page but a different or none as an individual page so once your comment move to archive, the page rank drops right away. What we go is look for archives post with high Page Ranks to comment on. Use the <a href="http://www.seochat.com/seo-tools/pagerank-search/">Page Rank Search Tool</a> on <a href="http://www.seochat.com/">SEOChat.com</a>. This tool list out individual page with their PR strength but they search general websites and cannot identified blogs separately. The trick will be to use &#8220;blogging&#8221; as a keyword in your search example &#8220;Making Money From Blogging&#8221; pulls up some archive posts from a few top bloggers. Work your way to the list and get 1000+ links in. On the next update you will have a higher PR for your blog.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://images.stockxpert.com/pic/m/h/hy/hypermania/842344_57765283.jpg"><img src="http://images.stockxpert.com/pic/m/h/hy/hypermania/842344_57765283.jpg" alt="" /></a>The question on most blogger&#8217;s mind after starting out for a while &#8220;What are the best ways to drive traffic to a blog?&#8221;. Traffic is the life line of a blog, without traffic there are no readers, without readers there is no point keep the blog. To get traffic is not enough, you need to get targeted traffic for your niche. Getting targeted traffic to your blog requires proper planning, measuring and execution. It should not be a &#8220;try this, its not working, try that, hope it works&#8221;.</p>

<p>I remember reading somewhere that &#8220;What gets measure gets improved&#8221; or something like that. What I am trying to say is that in-order to increase your traffic, you need a way to know that it is increasing. You can&#8217;t count the number of visitors by sitting in front of your computer screen and count hits. You need to install a counter or a script that tabulate the visitors information. If you are hosting your own blog, your hosting account might have a traffic statics of your visitors, but I will want to put in a few more tools to compare the results. I used a combination of counters and scripts. The most notable is <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google analytics</a>. This is a free tool from Google, it is a very comprehensive tool. You can track visitor by day, the keyword used to locate your blog, traffic referrals and much more. The other tool is <a href="https://crazyegg.com/">Crazy Egg</a>. I didn&#8217;t really find these useful when I try it then I discovered that it has special feature called &#8220;heatmap&#8221;. What is does is that it tracks what the user are clicking on your page and show it on a overlay of your blog, so you can see that exact location of the hits. This is extreme useful for those who are running PayPerClick ads. Crazy Egg is not a free tool, the basic package  starts from $9. However there&#8217;s a free version that allows you to measure up to 5000 visitors for 5 sites. The last tool I use is a counter from Bravenet. I been using Bravenet to host a lot of my website during Uni days. The counter have a lot similar function but less to Google analytics. I prefer bravenet counter over sitemeter because sitemeter does not display the counter on the web site. I like to see results instantly. Another piece of tool is Feedcounter from feedburner if your are burning your feed using feedburner. Although not directly related to traffic measurement, it can tell you how many subscriber you have per day, watching your feed count grow is a telltale sign that you are trapping your traffic.</p>

<p>Once we have the measurement in place, its time to get down to the strategies.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>SEO<br/>
Get your blog listed in the search engines for specific keywords that relate to your niche is the fastest and free way to generate traffic. The term normally used for these strategy is &#8220;organic search engine traffic&#8221;. In order get listed, you need to identified the keywords to used. A great tool to help you research what people are searching online, on Google, msn, yahoo, etc is  <a href="http://affiliate.wordtracker.com/publisher/aec1c19b">WordTraker</a>. Wordtracker offers a 2 hours free trial, however, you limited to the smallest search engine. In order to get Google results you can opt to purchase a one day license which is less than $10. Find the highest KEI keyword. You should look at keywords with KEI of 10 and above, this indicates that market are not saturated. Examples of good keywords are Learn, tips, tutorial, instruction, buy, training. Try to narrow down the demographic of your niche. Dog is a wide nice, small dog is better target but something like healthy food for small dog will probably get you more targeted traffics. Once you locate your keywords, Use keywords to form up part of your header text and titles, if you have already done so. Your content should contain the keywords right at the beginning of the page and in the title. Do not overuse keywords, keep this to 10% of the entire content. Use keywords in tags and tag your post with these keywords.</p></li>
<li><p>Publishing Your RSS Feed<br/>
Rss feed is the next most important thing next to your blog. An rss feed is simply an XML formated document of your blog. Most Blog comes with a default rss feed. However these feed are not display on the blog itself, you need to enable or use a script and image to display it. Most reader preferable to read a number of blog at once using rss readers like google reader, yahoo, netvibes, blogline etc. Feed Readers offer a number of advantage for blog readers, they are informed when a blog is update so they do not have constantly go back to the blog. To cater for all this feed reader you can choose to go to each of the readers to get the code to be place on your blog. An easier way to do this is via <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">Feedburner</a>. Get an account on Feedburner, and follow the simple instruction to set up your feeds.  If you have already burn your feed with feedburner, you be able to set up pingautomatic. pingautomatic is a service to update different search engines that your blog has updated. Once you have published your content, feedburner pings your blog to a wide variety of rss readers. Place your rss feed button at a prominent location, and add a feed count.</p></li>
<li><p>Submitting Articles To Directories<br/>
One of the most effective method of generating traffic used by Top Internet Marketers, can work for your blog too. Write 10-20 articles, 300-600 word related to your blog, you can simply recycle some of your blog post. Include your keywords add a short bio of yourself with a link back to your blog. Here&#8217;s some good article directories to get you started:</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.ezinearticles.com/">www.eZineArticles.com</a></p></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ultimatearticledirectory.com/">www.ultimatearticledirectory.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.submityourarticle.com/">www.submityourarticle.com</a></li>
<li><p>PPC (Pay Per Click)<br/>
One of the most effective traffic strategies used by top bloggers who makes more than $10,000 a month. PPC services include <a href="https://adwords.google.com/select/OnsiteSignupLandingPage?client=ca-pub-8721146355930630&amp;referringUrl=http://wizcoder.blogspot.com">Google Adwords</a>, <a href="http://www.adbrite.com/mb/landing_both.php?spid=50200&amp;afb=125x125-1">AdBrite</a> and <a href="http://bdv.bidvertiser.com/bidvertiser/referral_button.html?pid=57114">BidVertiser</a>.   All 3 services are similar you pay to display your ads with your targeted keywords on their ad network.  Well its not something new, most beginners fall in the trap of overspending on their advertisement. There 3 ways to use <a href="https://adwords.google.com/select/OnsiteSignupLandingPage?client=ca-pub-8721146355930630&amp;referringUrl=http://wizcoder.blogspot.com">Google Adwords.</a> Bidding for keywords on Google search page, Content network and site-targeted ads. When creating a campaign, its good to set a maximum daily budget so that you will not be shock by the amount payable at the end of the month. Create a campaign for Google search  and Content network separately. Bid low for content network and set a lower budget. Content network generate more clicks but conversion rate is lower. I bid 0.02 cents for content network and 0.5 cents for Google search. Write a separate ad for each keyword. Site-targeted ads can be used on other popular blogs. The cost starts at 0.5 cents. Extremely powerful if used properly. One the foremost expert on the topic is Perry Marshall, I suggest you study a lot more on adwords before you start on this. I started adwords without having any clue what I was doing. I have spent a few hundred dollars on adwords without generating much results. I learn the hard way so be smart invest in a little cost like <a href="http://m171.infusionsoft.com/go/default/javaongsan/">Perry Marshall&#8217;s AdWords Course</a>. Where to sent your traffic? Your blog main page is obvious but then you need to generate some sort of income from your investment. Regardless of where your traffic are from, you need to direct them to specific area of your blog. Instead of pointing to your main index, you<br/>
should experiment by sending your traffic to some of your better post. I sent my traffic to my <a href="http://wizcoder.blogspot.com/2007/06/money-maker.html">Money Maker</a> page which is a page on how I make money from blogging. When someone signs up the services form my referral, I make some money. You be surprise with the ROI. The recent not to sent the traffic directly to your home page is that sometime you go off topic on a post, a visitors is most likely to leave once they do get the information they are after.</p></li>
<li><p>Free Traffic Exchanges<br/>
Most of you are familiar with Free Traffic Exchanges sites. What is Traffic Exchanges ? A Traffic Exchanges site allow website owners display their websites for viewing from other members in exchange for viewing their sites. Most of these sites offer a free services and paid services. The differences is that paid services get more exposures. Here&#8217;s a list of free traffic  exchanges site:</p></li>

<a href="http://automatedtrafficmachine.com/trafficswarm/">TrafficSwarm</a> has been one my favorite and most effective traffic source.

<ol>
<li><p>Link Exchange<br/>
This should be part of SEO but I felt that its a wide topic by itself. Backlinks increase Google PageRank PR. I found this <a href="http://www.smartpagerank.com/pagerank-backlinks.php">new tool</a> from smartpagerank that is really good for checking your backlinks. This tool not only shows the backlinks, it shows the PR strength too. The sites you are looking at to exchange links should have a PR higher than yours, have lots of original contents, and have a large audiences contributions. It might seen difficult to exchange links with a larger, more successful site but if you are serious about your own site (operating your site with a goal) you will be able to get attention from them for your future growth. Link exchange should be treated with equal important for a website, as gathering content, traffic and design. Avoid link farm, exchange directories, or automated software. Leaving comments on blogs that follows  their comment links is another way to generate backlinks. You do not want to leave senseless comment or start spamming, leaving same comment like &#8220;please visit my site&#8230;blahblahblah&#8221; on every other blog. Participate in related forums. Create a link to your blog in your forum signature file. When you post in the forum, your link appears, it generate a few click for you. You can buy links from blogs that have higher PRs using <a href="http://www.text-link-ads.com/?ref=61054">Text Link Ads</a>. <a href="http://www.text-link-ads.com/?ref=61054">Text Link Ads</a> offers $100 to first timers but you need to credit $25 inorder to receive a $100 free credit. Buying a PR6 link get your site index by Google quicker.</p></li>
<li><p>Social Networking Sites<br/>
Friendster, Hi5, MySpace and facebook can used to promote your sites. With these sites there is already a reader base. You can used your social skills to make some new friends and hopefully they become your loyal readers. There another group of Social Networking Sites that meant for blogs like <a href="http://www.mybloglog.com/buzz/join/?ref_id=2006102502395364&amp;ref=w">MyBloglog</a> and <a href="http://www.blogcatalog.com/in/4276832">BlogCatalog</a>. If look on the right sidebar, you notice 2 widget one each from the <a href="http://www.mybloglog.com/buzz/join/?ref_id=2006102502395364&amp;ref=w">MyBloglog</a> and <a href="http://www.blogcatalog.com/in/4276832">BlogCatalog</a>. Any members from <a href="http://www.mybloglog.com/buzz/join/?ref_id=2006102502395364&amp;ref=w">MyBloglog</a> or <a href="http://www.blogcatalog.com/in/4276832">BlogCatalog</a> can join your blog community if they like your blog or you. As your network grow, your blog gets more exposure and attracts more readers. In order to be successful on mybloglog, you need a decent photo of yourself, not an object or cartoon, no studio photo as well. A good user name, no weird, funny or sleazy ones. Next, you start checking out other members and their blog. Most of them will start visiting your blog and community. There&#8217;s nothing more exciting than getting new faces on the widget everyday.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop Good Relationships With Your Readers And Other Blogs<br/>
Getting on a good relationship with other bloggers from your niche can help you get some traffic. You will want to collect a list of bloggers that you want to work with and start introducing yourself to them. When you create a new post that you think they might be interested in email them and your post might get me mention on their blog. Replying to comments of your readers is a great way to build up a lasting relationship. You can choose to reply to their comments in your comment space, write a post on the comment, comment on their blog or reply in an email.</p></li>
<li><p>Web 2.0 Sites<br/>
<a href="http://technorati.com/">Technorati</a>, <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/javaongsan">Squidoo</a>, <a href="http://digg.com/">Digg</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> and <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/">StumbleUpon</a>. These are some sites that you can work with to generate traffic. Out of all this web 2.0, I like to recommend you focus on <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/javaongsan">Squidoo</a>. In July all <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/javaongsan">Squidoo</a> lenses started to disappear from the Google Search Rankings due a large amount of spamming. However <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/javaongsan">Squidoo</a> have been putting a lot of effort in stopping spam. A lot of <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/javaongsan">Squidoo</a> traffic generators have left or not focusing on <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/javaongsan">Squidoo</a> anymore, which means once <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/javaongsan">Squidoo</a> returns those who have been working on their <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/javaongsan">Squidoo</a> lens are the ones who will benefit from it. Check out my <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/automatedtrafficmachine/">squidoo page</a>,   I have build my it to PR2 status.</p></li>
<li><p>Getting Traffic Offline<br/>
Beside traffic strategy online,We can generate traffic from offline sources. We can contribue articles to newspapers and magazines. Getting interview on papers, magazine, tv, or radio. Virally, spread it among friends and families. Network , at seminars, function, any chances you have to meet people. You need a card that have your name, email, phone number and most importantly your website url. Noticeboards, they are everywhere bustops, trainstation, schools, supermarkets. Some magazines and papers circlulated at a smaller scale, offers free classified sections. Print pamphlets from your own printers and hand them out at high human traffic areas. Use your car as a walking advertisement. Put up visible ads on your side doors, boot and rear windows.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Beside this few ideas, you can be creative and come up with unique ways of prompting your blog.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Feedburner Count<br/>
Nobody reads a blog that has low feed count. Here&#8217;s a quick fix.<br/>
Inflate your feedburner counter with photoshop. Like this <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Efc/Techcrunch?bg=FF6600&amp;fg=000000&amp;anim=0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Efc/Techcrunch?bg=FF6600&amp;fg=000000&amp;anim=0" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Inflate your feedburner count by suscribing to your own feed&#8230;a few thousand times. Google reader allows user to subscribe to rss feed more than once. You do it 10,000 times.</p>

<p>Comments<br/>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Basic SEO advice for Beginners. While these may not guarantee top placement for you website in any search engines, hopefully it will increase your chances of having indexed by them.</p>

<p>Keywords<br/>
The first step the most crucial, ask yourself &#8220;how do you want to be found?&#8221;. What do you want users to types in and for your site to show up. You can&#8217;t be found for every single keyword that they type in so you have to choose one word or a phrase that represents your site.</p>

<p>Some rules to abide by when deciding on keywords</p>

<ul>
<li>Choose a keyword that everybody are looking for</li>
<li>Do not choose a keyword that is unrelated to your website</li>
<li>Use a keyword that is relevant to your content.
Header and Title<br/>
Use keywords to from up part of your header text and titles.</li>
</ul>


<p>Meta Description and Meta Keywords are overrated so forget them.</p>

<p>Content<br/>
The content should contain the keywords right at the beginning of the page. Do not overuse keywords.<br/>
There&#8217;s no need to bother about submission to search engines, creating robot.txt or sitemaps. These are waste of time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Web designer, developer and coder pride themselves as Gog of the Internet, creator of things digital. They design website that uses the latest technology, fancy scripts, colorful moving objects, out-of-the-world flash but they can made a single cent on the web and THATS THE TRUE! How do I know? I have been a coder and have work the Internet for over 10 years and till recenlty I wasn&#8217;t making any money for myself or my clients. I list out the most common mistake a professional web designer are mostly to made.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Using Flash Template as a  website.</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>If you still living in 1990s, this is  fine but Web 2.0 are already here, so wake up and smell the digital  coffee. Flash templates are not interactive and they will never be.  They are just artistic piece of art that moves around on the web.  When you need a web designer, always ask for a PHP (a open source  software which means this tool is free) programmer who knows web  design and not a web designer who can build a website.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Using Flash on your website.</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>I have nothing against flash but even a tiny little flash program running on your web page can cause the amount of loading time your entire web page add together. Let me put it this way, “Flash is not cash”.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Using too many colours.</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>A basic website should only use a maximum of 4 colors. Background, Text, Link are most common identified color areas. There&#8217;s no need to be colorful, just think of a book, amgazine or newspaper you read recently, what the color of the text and whats the color of the background.</p>

<p><strong>Using Dark Background.</strong></p>

<p>The dark background are used a lot by hacker sites back in the 80s. White text on Black background may look really cool, it does not work for a normal website that is looking to attract consistent readers.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Using too many scripts.</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>Scripts like javascript, ajax, vbscript are common on web page to perform task that uses recourse from client machine and to take the load of the server. However too many scripts too will slow the whole web page down. You would want to remove fancy scripts that does not i any way benefit the user.</p>

<p><strong>The cute redirection.</strong></p>

<p>One of the worst script around is the redirection javascript. If you are using one, I beg you, please remove it. This script says “Please wait while we redirects you in a few seconds”. What happen if its does not work? This script will sent most of your visitor away before your script finish loading your site.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Inconsistent navigation style.</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>What can be worse than not able to find the link that you need? So many website uses fancy menu that pop in and out, and some will not stand still long enough for my mouse to click on them.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Fonts are too big or too small.</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>The font fraorite by designers and coder are a little smaller than what mormal web surfer prefer. We used to smaller fonts to see more codes and we use too it. We used fonts like courier that no one likes.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Not providing help or FAQ for  users.</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>Most designer will design the website but they will not take time to put in a help or faq on how to used the site, especially f its a community or forum. Even of a experience user it takes time to know what the website is trying to do and how to perform the action we want.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Everyone is talking about facebook recently, I am getting so much news and question from my friends(offlines) on facebook. Facebook is founded and created by Mark Zuckerberg a 23 year old Harvard dropout (ironically he was influenced by another famous Harvard dropout “to go out and make something happen”).</p>

<p><em><strong>History of Facebook</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>February 2004</strong>, Thefacebook.com, as it was originally called, was launched. Within two weeks, half the Harvard student body had signed up.<br/>
<strong>September 2005</strong>, Facebook opened up to high school students.<br/>
<strong>October 2005</strong>,  Facebook added a photo feature, and technical demands skyrocketed.<br/>
<strong>June 2006</strong>, the site was opened to work networks. There are more than 20,000 networks of employees, from major corporation and US government agency. Even MySpace has a corporate network of 22 employees.<br/>
<strong>September 2006</strong>, Facebook opens up to anyone with a valid email address.</p>

<p><a href="http://images.fastcompany.com/magazine/115/facebook1.jpg"><img src="http://images.fastcompany.com/magazine/115/facebook1.jpg" alt="" /></a><br/>
<strong>The Hacker</strong><br/>
<strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong> wanted to build an online student directory with photos and basic information, known at most schools as a face book. The school rejected the idea so Mark went ahead, he hacked into Harvard&#8217;s student records and created “Facemash”. This site has an algorithm that randomly paired photos of undergraduates and invited visitors to determine which one was &#8220;hotter&#8221;. The hack lasted only 4 hours, before Harvard step in. In 4 hours, the site managed to attract 450 visitors.  A revamp of approach and Mark set up the Facebook template that allows students fill in their own information. He spent most of his time o the new project instead of going to school. 2 days before art history final, he needed to be able to discuss 500 images from the Augustan period. Like a true hacker, he built a website with one image per page and a place for comments, invites his classmates to share their notes. Within two hours, all the images were populated with notes. Thats how you get homework done on Facebook! (extracted from <a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.fastcompany.com/magazine/115/open_features-hacker-dropout-ceo.html">fastcompany</a>)</p>

<p><strong>The Website</strong><br/>
If you have not being on Facebook, its very different from other social networking sites. If you use a work or school email address to register, you are auto-connect with coworkers or classmates.</p>

<p>Privacy is better than any othe sites I have been on. At Facebook, people should have control over how they share their information and who can see it. People can only see the profiles of confirmed friends and the people in their networks. You can use our privacy settings at any time to control who can see what on Facebook. Facebook has lots of ulities that make the platform so attractive. A unqiue feature such as sending message to email addresses from facebook. No more switching back and forth between email and Facebook. When you are writing a message, simply enter any emails you like into the “To:” field. They made Facebook accessable for iPhone or any other mobile browser. iPhone user access    iphone.facebook.com. Other devices go to m.facebook.com.<br/>
<a href="http://photos-c.ak.facebook.com/photos-ak-sctm/v124/75/57/500031439/a500031439_259470_411.jpg"><img src="http://photos-c.ak.facebook.com/photos-ak-sctm/v124/75/57/500031439/a500031439_259470_411.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>There are many other cool stuff you can do with Facebook. Get rid o your old stuff, product or buy something at the Facebook Markeplace. Write something, add video or shared items on your or your friend&#8217;s Wall. Join a group, you can join up to 200 groups.</p>

<p>Developers<br/>
Facebook is build on PHP and Mysql, both open source softwares, which makes it more stable and extendable. To allow other developers to work on Facebook, Facebook Platform wass luanched, it is a standards-based web service with methods for accessing and contributing Facebook data. Facebook Platform is Facebook&#8217;s initiative to allow developers from around the world to build new applications for the site. Check out the <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/documentation.php?v=1.0">API Documentation</a> for supported functions and examples. Sign up for an <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/account.php">API Key</a>. To date, there are over 2500 applications available, and growing.</p>

<p>However not all applications are weclome, Techcruch wrote a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/09/06/facebook-opening-up-but-on-its-own-terms/">story</a> about a independent programmer who ran into a bit of trouble with <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/facebook">Facebook</a> over a snippet of code he developed and published that allowed users to update their Facebook status without visiting the site.</p>

<p>Ready for Facebook, all you needed to join is a valid email address. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=630480292">Check out my Facebook profile here</a></p>
