  <div class="entry-content"><p>The biggest trievent of the year is the Singapore 70.3 HIM. The race course map is out. Check it out.</p>

<p><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_VgnX_0XbCps/RsL5NkH6KNI/AAAAAAAAADw/ZKwUMufg6A4/s1600-h/Aviva_IM703_Race+Route_big.jpg"><img src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_VgnX_0XbCps/RsL5NkH6KNI/AAAAAAAAADw/ZKwUMufg6A4/s200/Aviva_IM703_Race+Route_big.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Swim Course<br/>
The swim is based along Singapore&#8217;s coast in warm, usually calm inshore waters. It is an ocean swim in saltwater, and commences with a  number of waves starts from the beach. Singapore waters are warm, hence wetsuits will not be required. Visibility is about 1.5 meters. The course will take swimmers on a one lap rectangular course over 1.9kms in total as mapped.</p>

<p>Bike Course<br/>
The bike course is 98% fast and flat and the Aviva Ironman 70.3 Singapore bike leg promises a memorable and unique city course, not found in most races. Whilst fast, it will feature one technical aspect in each lap that needs to be remembered.</p>

<p>Run Course<br/>
The course is two (2) laps and will feature six (6) aid stations during the run on each lap. At some points, there will also be light shower stations to cool off, and fruit stations for energy replacement. The run course at this time will be hot and itâ€™s fast and flat but also features shaded paths, most of the time. The finishing point will be on the Champs Arena (Floating Platform)  following which there is an aid station in the form of a recovery area.</p>

<p>The run itself will take competitors along the shoreline of Marina Centre, the city park that overlooks the towering skyscrapers of the Central Business District. It has stunning panoramic views of the city skyline.  The park has many shelters and benches and it is an excellent place for spectators to cheer on their favourite athletes!</p>

<p>The aid stations on the run will ALL carry water, PowerBar Endurance Drink and flat Coke. Aid stations One and Two will have bananas and oranges in addition to liquids and aid station 6 will have PowerGels.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you have read Alex Mandossian&#8217;s Action steps, you know that he suggested that we watch our time using a count down time. Ever since I read this I have been looking for one. A physical countdown time is either too expensive or too small. So i developed one that will run on my screen and stay on top of all my applications. Now i can set a target for my self each time I start a new process.</p>

<p>You can down load the software here.  <a href="http://automatedtrafficmachine.com/download/Timer.zip">http://automatedtrafficmachine.com/download/Timer.zip<br/>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s simple Google PageRank PR is directly related to the no. of backlinks to your blog. Not just any backlinks, links that will be pickup by google. To check your backlinks, go to google.com type in the search box &#8220;link:http://www.yoursite.com&#8221;. Before you exchange your links, you should check out the site that you are exchange links with.</p>

<p>What makes a good site for link exchange.?</p>

<ol>
<li>Site with a PR higher than yours is good.</li>
<li>Site with lots of original contents.</li>
<li>Site with at least 50 google links.</li>
<li>Site with a large audiences contributions.</li>
<li>Site with operated with a goal.
Well this is not a checklist, you should be careful of were you linking to. It might seen difficult to  exchange links with a larger, more successful site but if you are serious about your own site (operating your site with a goal) you will be able to get attention from them for your future growth. Link exchange should be treated with equal important for a website, as  gathering content, traffic and design. Avoid link farm, exchange directories, or automated software.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The first-ever Ironman in China will take place on April 20, 2008 in Haikou, the capital city of Hainan Province. According to <a href="http://vnews.ironmanlive.com/events/ironman/worldchampionship/haikou-set-to-host-race-on-april-20-2008">ironmanlive.com</a> Ironman China Ltd. (ICL) has announced that it has entered a hosting agreement with the City of Haikou, Hainan, for the staging of the inaugural Ironman China triathlon.</p>

<p>Hainan Island, known as the Hawaii of China, is a beautiful tropical island located in the South China Sea about an hour by air from Hong Kong. Haikou, the islandâ€™s principal city and capital, has a population of 1,700,000 and featuresChina_Course__park_prime.jpg world-class resort hotels, sandy beaches and a vibrant city life.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Are you doing it all wrong? You may be killing your own blog.</p>

<p>You log in to your blog, you write the post, you logout. Standard routine. STOP! Think you are doing everything correctly? Don&#8217;t write another blog post until you read this.</p>

<p>Not Choosing the right title for your post<br/>
The title is the first contact point between you and your blog readers, if it fails to impact the reader, your post might not be read. How many times have simply chucking the title after you have complete writing the content? Its common for top bloggers to use interesting titles to catch the readers attention. Why spent a little more time on your titles.</p>

<p>Not using the right targeted keyword for your post<br/>
Every webmaster knows that keyword is the key to SEO. Choosing the right target keywords can make or break a website, influences its ranking on searching engines, but do you know that your content should have targeted keywords? How much time did you spent on planning that keyword for your content? Not only is the keyword for your content important, it is essential to tag your post with the right keyword tag.</p>

<p>Announcing your post<br/>
I have read from many top bloggers that you should email other blogger about your new post. I have not personally tried this and I probable should be doing. Ever wonder why some blogger&#8217;s post get  mention by a few bloggers? Why not try emailing a few other bloggers for your next post asking for feedbacks.</p>

<p>Returning comments<br/>
I only learn about returning comments recently. One of the key ingredient of building a great blog is relationship building. Returning comments not only keeps the commenter on your blog but make your blog interactive, and thats the whole point of web 2.0 and blogging.</p>

<p>If you are making the same mistakes, STOP!</p>

Featured lenses are those with a LensRank above a certain threshold. If your lens is featured, it shows up in Squidoo search results. Work-in-Progress lenses, on the other hand, have a LensRank below that threshold. If your lens is a Work-in-Progress, it won&#8217;t be featured in Squidoo search results. It will still be accessible via your direct URL and through other search engines. Featured lenses are marked with green check mark and and not Work-in-Progress lenses with gray minus sign. To get Featured lenses status you need to  update your content and keep your rss feeds, guestbooks, plexus active.</p>
