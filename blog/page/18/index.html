  <div class="entry-content"><p>Everyone is talking about facebook recently, I am getting so much news and question from my friends(offlines) on facebook. Facebook is founded and created by Mark Zuckerberg a 23 year old Harvard dropout (ironically he was influenced by another famous Harvard dropout “to go out and make something happen”).</p>

<p><em><strong>History of Facebook</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>February 2004</strong>, Thefacebook.com, as it was originally called, was launched. Within two weeks, half the Harvard student body had signed up.<br/>
<strong>September 2005</strong>, Facebook opened up to high school students.<br/>
<strong>October 2005</strong>,  Facebook added a photo feature, and technical demands skyrocketed.<br/>
<strong>June 2006</strong>, the site was opened to work networks. There are more than 20,000 networks of employees, from major corporation and US government agency. Even MySpace has a corporate network of 22 employees.<br/>
<strong>September 2006</strong>, Facebook opens up to anyone with a valid email address.</p>

<p><a href="http://images.fastcompany.com/magazine/115/facebook1.jpg"><img src="http://images.fastcompany.com/magazine/115/facebook1.jpg" alt="" /></a><br/>
<strong>The Hacker</strong><br/>
<strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong> wanted to build an online student directory with photos and basic information, known at most schools as a face book. The school rejected the idea so Mark went ahead, he hacked into Harvard&#8217;s student records and created “Facemash”. This site has an algorithm that randomly paired photos of undergraduates and invited visitors to determine which one was &#8220;hotter&#8221;. The hack lasted only 4 hours, before Harvard step in. In 4 hours, the site managed to attract 450 visitors.  A revamp of approach and Mark set up the Facebook template that allows students fill in their own information. He spent most of his time o the new project instead of going to school. 2 days before art history final, he needed to be able to discuss 500 images from the Augustan period. Like a true hacker, he built a website with one image per page and a place for comments, invites his classmates to share their notes. Within two hours, all the images were populated with notes. Thats how you get homework done on Facebook! (extracted from <a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.fastcompany.com/magazine/115/open_features-hacker-dropout-ceo.html">fastcompany</a>)</p>

<p><strong>The Website</strong><br/>
If you have not being on Facebook, its very different from other social networking sites. If you use a work or school email address to register, you are auto-connect with coworkers or classmates.</p>

<p>Privacy is better than any othe sites I have been on. At Facebook, people should have control over how they share their information and who can see it. People can only see the profiles of confirmed friends and the people in their networks. You can use our privacy settings at any time to control who can see what on Facebook. Facebook has lots of ulities that make the platform so attractive. A unqiue feature such as sending message to email addresses from facebook. No more switching back and forth between email and Facebook. When you are writing a message, simply enter any emails you like into the “To:” field. They made Facebook accessable for iPhone or any other mobile browser. iPhone user access    iphone.facebook.com. Other devices go to m.facebook.com.<br/>
<a href="http://photos-c.ak.facebook.com/photos-ak-sctm/v124/75/57/500031439/a500031439_259470_411.jpg"><img src="http://photos-c.ak.facebook.com/photos-ak-sctm/v124/75/57/500031439/a500031439_259470_411.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>There are many other cool stuff you can do with Facebook. Get rid o your old stuff, product or buy something at the Facebook Markeplace. Write something, add video or shared items on your or your friend&#8217;s Wall. Join a group, you can join up to 200 groups.</p>

<p>Developers<br/>
Facebook is build on PHP and Mysql, both open source softwares, which makes it more stable and extendable. To allow other developers to work on Facebook, Facebook Platform wass luanched, it is a standards-based web service with methods for accessing and contributing Facebook data. Facebook Platform is Facebook&#8217;s initiative to allow developers from around the world to build new applications for the site. Check out the <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/documentation.php?v=1.0">API Documentation</a> for supported functions and examples. Sign up for an <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/account.php">API Key</a>. To date, there are over 2500 applications available, and growing.</p>

<p>However not all applications are weclome, Techcruch wrote a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/09/06/facebook-opening-up-but-on-its-own-terms/">story</a> about a independent programmer who ran into a bit of trouble with <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/facebook">Facebook</a> over a snippet of code he developed and published that allowed users to update their Facebook status without visiting the site.</p>

<p>Ready for Facebook, all you needed to join is a valid email address. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=630480292">Check out my Facebook profile here</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Earning continues to fall. One of the reason is losing he PR1 status. The number of rss subscribe have dropped by 100+- in August the only drop and the highest since rss subscribing start gaining speed in May. It was increasing 10-20 daily. Still the downfall was lack of communication to the readers, judging from the number of comments  left. This month I will report any income that has make at least 10 dollars. I will not use table format anymore, blogger have a habit of distorting my tables. <a href="http://tinyurl.com/23pnjg"> payperpost</a>- $11. Surprisingly this is all I made this month.</p>

<p>I am experimenting with a few new ads network, 2 of which is local. Till my PR increase , I will be doing another <a href="http://tinyurl.com/23pnjg"> payperpost</a>. I have plans to migrate my blog out of blogger, a large part of my archives, which are useless will be deleted.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have you wander if your blogger blog can be sold? How much can it sell for? We all know that blogs can be sold but thats mostly self-hosted wordpress. First of all Why would anyone buy something thats created for free? Traffic? PR Rank? Lots of original contents? One criteria  would be the monthly income of that blog. Or maybe the blog&#8217;s potential when monetized. Will you sell your blog if the price is right?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In an attempt to savage my blog earning, I will try out several others money making opportunities. One which I have sing up but have not take part in, is “Advertlets”. Advertlets is similar to other Ad networks except that it is started by a Malaysian company. Josh Lim is the technopreneur behind Advertlets, he runs Josh Lim &amp; Associates. Bloggers make money by selling advertising space on their blogs.  It&#8217;s style is heavily localise with lots of local Malaysia and Singapore slangs. Advertlets targets at blogger and advertisers from Singapore and Malaysia. This done in-order for local advertisers get to connect their message to the right audience.</p>

<p>Adverlets requirements are simple. To qualify, you must be at least 16 years old. There are no traffic requirements. Your blog must also not contain any inflammatory or illegal content. Currently they are running a “SGD 8800 for 300 Singaporean Bloggers” promotion. The detail are  not well described but they are giving away $25 for any Singaporean blogger who join and write a post about them.</p>

<p>Advertlets Compared With Other Online Advertising Services and Suggestions On How Advertlets Can Improve Further.<br/>
If you look closely, Adverlets is a pretty new company and this system is in beta. Looking around the system, is tough even for a experience user. Its takes a wile to dig out the company history. I spent somtime looking for codes and your affiliates links. Apparently there are no textlink affiliate links only plug in javascript. I will definitely loose quite a bit of referrals, and I do not know if there are benefits for referrals. My preferred method of payment paypal is not included, payment are sent by old fashion cheques.</p>

<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_VgnX_0XbCps/RsfVTEaYF9I/AAAAAAAAAD4/jqaTAImXnSI/s1600-h/Ad.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_VgnX_0XbCps/RsfVTEaYF9I/AAAAAAAAAD4/jqaTAImXnSI/s200/Ad.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>If you are either from Malaysia or Singapore, Adverlets might just work for you, but then don&#8217;t put all your eggs in one baskets. This is just one of the small basket that you can try out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Google PR update happen recently. I notice a few of the site I visited drop in their PR. A number of blog have PR reduce to o or nothing. My blog PR went from 3 to 1 to nothing. I believe that the algorithm have been updated, they always do,  but then we will not know what was updated. I hope that some day I be able to see the codes behind the search engine.</p>

<p>PageRank Explained (extract from <a href="http://www.google.com/technology/">http://www.google.com/technology/</a>)<br/>
PageRank relies on the uniquely democratic nature of the web by using its vast link structure as an indicator of an individual page&#8217;s value. In essence, Google interprets a link from page A to page B as a vote, by page A, for page B. But, Google looks at considerably more than the sheer volume of votes, or links a page receives; for example, it also analyzes the page that casts the vote. Votes cast by pages that are themselves &#8220;important&#8221; weigh more heavily and help to make other pages &#8220;important.&#8221; Using these and other factors, Google provides its views on pages&#8217; relative importance.</p>

<p>Of course, important pages mean nothing to you if they don&#8217;t match your query. So, Google combines PageRank with sophisticated text-matching techniques to find pages that are both important and relevant to your search. Google goes far beyond the number of times a term appears on a page and examines dozens of aspects of the page&#8217;s content (and the content of the pages linking to it) to determine if it&#8217;s a good match for your query.</p>

<p>My link build wasn&#8217;t intensive, and using link exchange sites doesn&#8217;t help either.  To get better Pr you need to be link by sites that have quality content, higher PR than yours and of the same topic. If I am a normal web master I would not be bother by page rank updates, however if you are involved in Paid Post program like <a href="http://tinyurl.com/23pnjg">Payperpost</a> you need higher PR to get paid better. Most of these program uses Google PR and Alexa ranking as bench marks. Alexa is is measurement of your blog from user who have a Alexa toolbar plug-in on their browser when they surf your sites. The measurement  are inaccurate  and difficult to improve on, many web site owner do not include Alexa as a gauge of their site traffic. Google PR is more accurate but harder to archive, the only thing that is made know is to improve the content of your site and the backlinks form  quality sites.</p>

<p>As my page rank comes down, blogging for services like <a href="http://tinyurl.com/23pnjg">Payperpost</a> becomes harder. Using ad networks is not a good solution with a site that has only less than 200 page views a day. I would be looking for a better way to make money from my blog.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On the topic of updating your content more than once per day, many blogger state time and resources as the main obstacle to posting more than once a day. There are several ways to overcome time restraint.</p>

<p>Preparing your all your content beforehand<br/>
Type all your post on notepad or your chose of application or simply save a draft copy on your blogging platform. When its time to release them, you can log in to post them or you can set up email posting. Several blog platform allow email posting. You can also schedule your email with some email services. This way everything is automated.</p>

<p>Using Guest Bloggers<br/>
My prefer method to getting more content per day. Too bad I have not found anyone who are willing to guest post for my blog. Using guest blogger takes the workload off you and let reader experience different style of blogging. Guest blogger can be given a account which they can post freely at any given time slot or they simply submit articles to you directly. This is especial useful if you are going away for a while and have no access to internet. Having someone manning your blog while you away keeps your blog activities and your mind at ease.</p>

<p>Hiring a someone to do it<br/>
If are willing you can pay some one to blog for as little as $1 per article. Such blogger can be found on sites like getafreelancer.com or any other source. The advantage of this method is the variety of writter you will get, the down site is that you have to ay them.</p>

<p>Whichever method you choose updating you content regularly is critical for your blog.</p>
