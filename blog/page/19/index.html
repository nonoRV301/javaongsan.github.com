  <div class="entry-content"><p>Are you doing it all wrong? You may be killing your own blog.</p>

<p>You log in to your blog, you write the post, you logout. Standard routine. STOP! Think you are doing everything correctly? Don&#8217;t write another blog post until you read this.</p>

<p>Not Choosing the right title for your post<br/>
The title is the first contact point between you and your blog readers, if it fails to impact the reader, your post might not be read. How many times have simply chucking the title after you have complete writing the content? Its common for top bloggers to use interesting titles to catch the readers attention. Why spent a little more time on your titles.</p>

<p>Not using the right targeted keyword for your post<br/>
Every webmaster knows that keyword is the key to SEO. Choosing the right target keywords can make or break a website, influences its ranking on searching engines, but do you know that your content should have targeted keywords? How much time did you spent on planning that keyword for your content? Not only is the keyword for your content important, it is essential to tag your post with the right keyword tag.</p>

<p>Announcing your post<br/>
I have read from many top bloggers that you should email other blogger about your new post. I have not personally tried this and I probable should be doing. Ever wonder why some blogger&#8217;s post get  mention by a few bloggers? Why not try emailing a few other bloggers for your next post asking for feedbacks.</p>

<p>Returning comments<br/>
I only learn about returning comments recently. One of the key ingredient of building a great blog is relationship building. Returning comments not only keeps the commenter on your blog but make your blog interactive, and thats the whole point of web 2.0 and blogging.</p>

<p>If you are making the same mistakes, STOP!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/javaongsan">Suqidoo</a> have split lens into 2 categories: Featured lenses and Work-in-Progress lenses. Featured lenses are those with a LensRank above a certain threshold. If your lens is featured, it shows up in Squidoo search results. Work-in-Progress lenses, on the other hand, have a LensRank below that threshold. If your lens is a Work-in-Progress, it won&#8217;t be featured in Squidoo search results. It will still be accessible via your direct URL and through other search engines. Featured lenses are marked with green check mark and and not Work-in-Progress lenses with gray minus sign. To get Featured lenses status you need to  update your content and keep your rss feeds, guestbooks, plexus active.</p>

There are somethings that we can learn from  observing our rss reader to make our blog stand out from all the thousand of feed subscribed.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Title<br/>
Title are mostly alphabetically ranked so having a higher alphabet blog title helps. &#8220;A Way To Make Money Blogging&#8221; is higher than &#8220;Make Money Blogging&#8221;. Number is higher than alphabets.</p></li>
<li><p>Interesting title for your post<br/>
Reader are most likely to scan through all available blog post titles and pick the title they are interested in to read.</p></li>
<li><p>A brief introduction to your post.<br/>
f your post is long you  might want to do a brief introduction paragraph to engage the readers into the main article or you can keep your post short to the point.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a link back to your blog.<br/>
Most rss feeds do not have a link back to their blog, or maybe some rss readers do not have that capabilities. You can simply add a link back to your blog at the end of your feed.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The single most important task before starting a money making blog is to research a profitable niche to go into. Still many people tend to skip this step. Do not rush off to the hottest market out there and try to get a piece of the action. The idea of researching for a niche market is to find a hot market that have a large demand and very little supply, thus you dominate the market.</p>

<p><strong>How are we going to locate that niche? </strong></p>

<p>Take Inventory of your skills, hobbies, expertise. What are you good at? What do people come to you for advice?<br/>
Some sources of inspiration for us include:<br/>
* our hobbies, and the hobbies of our family or friends<br/>
* our work<br/>
* our personal interests and problems<br/>
* magazines and newspapers (I always get ideas from the Virgin airlines in-flight mag, Voyeur)<br/>
* TV shows, especially current affairs or niche channels (like Lifestyle or Discovery).</p>

<p>A great tool to help you research what people are searching online, on Google, msn, yahoo, etc is WordTraker. Do keyword research at <a href="http://affiliate.wordtracker.com/publisher/aec1c19b">http://www.<strong>wordtracker</strong>.com.</a> Wordtracker offers a 2 hours free trial, however, you limited to the smallest search engine. In order to get Google results you can opt to purchase a one day license.</p>

<p>Find the highest KEI keyword. You should look at keywords with KEI of 10 and above, this indicates that market are not saturated.  Examples of good keywords are Learn, tips, tutorial, instruction, buy, training. Try to narrow down the demographic of your niche. Dog is a wide nice, small dog is better target but something like healthy food for small dog will probably get you more targeted traffics.</p>

<p>Forum are another area to research niches. Look at forum headers on <a href="http://domz.org/">domz.org. </a>Google for common headline, look at what people are asking. Find that right niche is the key to your success and you should be spending a large amount of time there.</p>

<p>To realize your vision, you must answer all this question and write them down. When its written down on paper, your vision becomes clear. Ideas can be quickly forgotten, write them down and turn it into a plan.  What specific steps do you have to take toward your vision?</p>

<p>What’s your vision and ho$w will you implement it?</p>

<p>The drop are mainly because blogger mark my blog as spam at the beginning of the month for about 3 -4 days, and I remove most of the ad networks, change my template and did less paid posts. For next month, I will remove Adsense as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just log on <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/javaongsan">Squidoo</a> and found that some of the interfaces have changed. Its more compact design now, I am able to view all my lens better now. Besides physical changes, <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/javaongsan">Squidoo</a> have achieve a lot since I last wrote about them. For instances, they hit 9 million page views per month, reached 150,000 lenses.</p>

<p>What is <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/javaongsan">Squidoo</a>?<br/>
<a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/javaongsan">Squidoo</a> is an easy-to-build, single web page that can point to blogs, favorite links, RSS feeds, Flickr photos, Google maps, your eBay auctions, CafePress designs, Amazon books or music, and more. <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/javaongsan">Squidoo</a> offers highly focused content which often rises to the top of the search engine rankings very quickly. <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/javaongsan">Squidoo</a> has a PR7 (Page Rank) in Google. According to Alexa, <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/javaongsan">Squidoo</a> is ranked in the top 1000 sites on the whole web. So <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/javaongsan">Squidoo</a> is really a powerful site for you to get exposure. You might want to use this to promote your new site or blog but I am going to talk about making money directly from it.</p>

<p>First there a few terms you need to get use to.<br/>
1. Lens<br/>
It&#8217;s an easy-to-build, single web page that can point to blogs, favorite links, RSS feeds, Flickr photos, Google maps, your eBay auctions, CafePress designs, Amazon books or music, and more.</p>

<hr />

<ol>
<li>Module<br/>
Modules are the building blocks of lenses. A module makes it easy to point to links, images, blogs or even things to buy. Modules can be content with html or rss feeds or  commerce-oriented.</li>
</ol>


<p>You can view a sample of my lens: <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/automatedtrafficmachine/">http://www.squidoo.com/automatedtrafficmachine/</a></p>

<p>How to make money?<br/>
You make money when visitors stops by your lens and buys a product you recommended or clicks on a Google ad, you get 50% of the royalties. If you don&#8217;t like money, select one of our 80+ nonprofit partners to donate these royalties to.</p>

<p>They mainly 2 types of payout here:<br/>
AdSense<br/>
This money goes into a pool, half of the pool distributes out to lensmasters, based on each lens&#8217;s average LensRank and traffic.</p>

<p>Affiliate revenue (ie, referral income&#8211;like Amazon and eBay and CafePress and SuperStore sales).<br/>
This is directly attributable to the lens that generated the revenue. The lensmaster gets a straight 50%.<br/>
Example, If your lens sells 1 book and Amazon pays us $1.05 in affiliate income, we send a nickel to charity and fifty cents to you.</p>

<p>How to build a successful lens?<br/>
1. Constant content updates<br/>

3. Use Plexo<br/>
