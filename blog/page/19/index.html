  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you have read Alex Mandossian&#8217;s Action steps, you know that he suggested that we watch our time using a count down time. Ever since I read this I have been looking for one. A physical countdown time is either too expensive or too small. So i developed one that will run on my screen and stay on top of all my applications. Now i can set a target for my self each time I start a new process.</p>

<p>You can down load the software here.  <a href="http://automatedtrafficmachine.com/download/Timer.zip">http://automatedtrafficmachine.com/download/Timer.zip<br/>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s simple Google PageRank PR is directly related to the no. of backlinks to your blog. Not just any backlinks, links that will be pickup by google. To check your backlinks, go to google.com type in the search box &#8220;link:http://www.yoursite.com&#8221;. Before you exchange your links, you should check out the site that you are exchange links with.</p>

<p>What makes a good site for link exchange.?</p>

<ol>
<li>Site with a PR higher than yours is good.</li>
<li>Site with lots of original contents.</li>
<li>Site with at least 50 google links.</li>
<li>Site with a large audiences contributions.</li>
<li>Site with operated with a goal.
Well this is not a checklist, you should be careful of were you linking to. It might seen difficult to  exchange links with a larger, more successful site but if you are serious about your own site (operating your site with a goal) you will be able to get attention from them for your future growth. Link exchange should be treated with equal important for a website, as  gathering content, traffic and design. Avoid link farm, exchange directories, or automated software.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The first-ever Ironman in China will take place on April 20, 2008 in Haikou, the capital city of Hainan Province. According to <a href="http://vnews.ironmanlive.com/events/ironman/worldchampionship/haikou-set-to-host-race-on-april-20-2008">ironmanlive.com</a> Ironman China Ltd. (ICL) has announced that it has entered a hosting agreement with the City of Haikou, Hainan, for the staging of the inaugural Ironman China triathlon.</p>

<p>Hainan Island, known as the Hawaii of China, is a beautiful tropical island located in the South China Sea about an hour by air from Hong Kong. Haikou, the islandâ€™s principal city and capital, has a population of 1,700,000 and featuresChina_Course__park_prime.jpg world-class resort hotels, sandy beaches and a vibrant city life.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Are you doing it all wrong? You may be killing your own blog.</p>

<p>You log in to your blog, you write the post, you logout. Standard routine. STOP! Think you are doing everything correctly? Don&#8217;t write another blog post until you read this.</p>

<p>Not Choosing the right title for your post<br/>
The title is the first contact point between you and your blog readers, if it fails to impact the reader, your post might not be read. How many times have simply chucking the title after you have complete writing the content? Its common for top bloggers to use interesting titles to catch the readers attention. Why spent a little more time on your titles.</p>

<p>Not using the right targeted keyword for your post<br/>
Every webmaster knows that keyword is the key to SEO. Choosing the right target keywords can make or break a website, influences its ranking on searching engines, but do you know that your content should have targeted keywords? How much time did you spent on planning that keyword for your content? Not only is the keyword for your content important, it is essential to tag your post with the right keyword tag.</p>

<p>Announcing your post<br/>
I have read from many top bloggers that you should email other blogger about your new post. I have not personally tried this and I probable should be doing. Ever wonder why some blogger&#8217;s post get  mention by a few bloggers? Why not try emailing a few other bloggers for your next post asking for feedbacks.</p>

<p>Returning comments<br/>
I only learn about returning comments recently. One of the key ingredient of building a great blog is relationship building. Returning comments not only keeps the commenter on your blog but make your blog interactive, and thats the whole point of web 2.0 and blogging.</p>

<p>If you are making the same mistakes, STOP!</p>

Featured lenses are those with a LensRank above a certain threshold. If your lens is featured, it shows up in Squidoo search results. Work-in-Progress lenses, on the other hand, have a LensRank below that threshold. If your lens is a Work-in-Progress, it won&#8217;t be featured in Squidoo search results. It will still be accessible via your direct URL and through other search engines. Featured lenses are marked with green check mark and and not Work-in-Progress lenses with gray minus sign. To get Featured lenses status you need to  update your content and keep your rss feeds, guestbooks, plexus active.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Do you us a rss reader to read all your favorite blogs? I use Thunderbird for my rss reader, simply because its my email reader.<br/>
There are somethings that we can learn from  observing our rss reader to make our blog stand out from all the thousand of feed subscribed.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Title<br/>
Title are mostly alphabetically ranked so having a higher alphabet blog title helps. &#8220;A Way To Make Money Blogging&#8221; is higher than &#8220;Make Money Blogging&#8221;. Number is higher than alphabets.</p></li>
<li><p>Interesting title for your post<br/>
Reader are most likely to scan through all available blog post titles and pick the title they are interested in to read.</p></li>
<li><p>A brief introduction to your post.<br/>
f your post is long you  might want to do a brief introduction paragraph to engage the readers into the main article or you can keep your post short to the point.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a link back to your blog.<br/>
Most rss feeds do not have a link back to their blog, or maybe some rss readers do not have that capabilities. You can simply add a link back to your blog at the end of your feed.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The single most important task before starting a money making blog is to research a profitable niche to go into. Still many people tend to skip this step. Do not rush off to the hottest market out there and try to get a piece of the action. The idea of researching for a niche market is to find a hot market that have a large demand and very little supply, thus you dominate the market.</p>

<p><strong>How are we going to locate that niche? </strong></p>

<p>Take Inventory of your skills, hobbies, expertise. What are you good at? What do people come to you for advice?<br/>
Some sources of inspiration for us include:<br/>
* our hobbies, and the hobbies of our family or friends<br/>
* our work<br/>
* our personal interests and problems<br/>
* magazines and newspapers (I always get ideas from the Virgin airlines in-flight mag, Voyeur)<br/>
* TV shows, especially current affairs or niche channels (like Lifestyle or Discovery).</p>

<p>A great tool to help you research what people are searching online, on Google, msn, yahoo, etc is WordTraker. Do keyword research at <a href="http://affiliate.wordtracker.com/publisher/aec1c19b">http://www.<strong>wordtracker</strong>.com.</a> Wordtracker offers a 2 hours free trial, however, you limited to the smallest search engine. In order to get Google results you can opt to purchase a one day license.</p>

<p>Find the highest KEI keyword. You should look at keywords with KEI of 10 and above, this indicates that market are not saturated.  Examples of good keywords are Learn, tips, tutorial, instruction, buy, training. Try to narrow down the demographic of your niche. Dog is a wide nice, small dog is better target but something like healthy food for small dog will probably get you more targeted traffics.</p>

<p>Forum are another area to research niches. Look at forum headers on <a href="http://domz.org/">domz.org. </a>Google for common headline, look at what people are asking. Find that right niche is the key to your success and you should be spending a large amount of time there.</p>
