  <div class="entry-content"><p>Do you us a rss reader to read all your favorite blogs? I use Thunderbird for my rss reader, simply because its my email reader.<br/>
There are somethings that we can learn from  observing our rss reader to make our blog stand out from all the thousand of feed subscribed.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Title<br/>
Title are mostly alphabetically ranked so having a higher alphabet blog title helps. &#8220;A Way To Make Money Blogging&#8221; is higher than &#8220;Make Money Blogging&#8221;. Number is higher than alphabets.</p></li>
<li><p>Interesting title for your post<br/>
Reader are most likely to scan through all available blog post titles and pick the title they are interested in to read.</p></li>
<li><p>A brief introduction to your post.<br/>
f your post is long you  might want to do a brief introduction paragraph to engage the readers into the main article or you can keep your post short to the point.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a link back to your blog.<br/>
Most rss feeds do not have a link back to their blog, or maybe some rss readers do not have that capabilities. You can simply add a link back to your blog at the end of your feed.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The single most important task before starting a money making blog is to research a profitable niche to go into. Still many people tend to skip this step. Do not rush off to the hottest market out there and try to get a piece of the action. The idea of researching for a niche market is to find a hot market that have a large demand and very little supply, thus you dominate the market.</p>

<p><strong>How are we going to locate that niche? </strong></p>

<p>Take Inventory of your skills, hobbies, expertise. What are you good at? What do people come to you for advice?<br/>
Some sources of inspiration for us include:<br/>
* our hobbies, and the hobbies of our family or friends<br/>
* our work<br/>
* our personal interests and problems<br/>
* magazines and newspapers (I always get ideas from the Virgin airlines in-flight mag, Voyeur)<br/>
* TV shows, especially current affairs or niche channels (like Lifestyle or Discovery).</p>

<p>A great tool to help you research what people are searching online, on Google, msn, yahoo, etc is WordTraker. Do keyword research at <a href="http://affiliate.wordtracker.com/publisher/aec1c19b">http://www.<strong>wordtracker</strong>.com.</a> Wordtracker offers a 2 hours free trial, however, you limited to the smallest search engine. In order to get Google results you can opt to purchase a one day license.</p>

<p>Find the highest KEI keyword. You should look at keywords with KEI of 10 and above, this indicates that market are not saturated.  Examples of good keywords are Learn, tips, tutorial, instruction, buy, training. Try to narrow down the demographic of your niche. Dog is a wide nice, small dog is better target but something like healthy food for small dog will probably get you more targeted traffics.</p>

<p>Forum are another area to research niches. Look at forum headers on <a href="http://domz.org/">domz.org. </a>Google for common headline, look at what people are asking. Find that right niche is the key to your success and you should be spending a large amount of time there.</p>

<p>To realize your vision, you must answer all this question and write them down. When its written down on paper, your vision becomes clear. Ideas can be quickly forgotten, write them down and turn it into a plan.  What specific steps do you have to take toward your vision?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just log on <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/javaongsan">Squidoo</a> and found that some of the interfaces have changed. Its more compact design now, I am able to view all my lens better now. Besides physical changes, <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/javaongsan">Squidoo</a> have achieve a lot since I last wrote about them. For instances, they hit 9 million page views per month, reached 150,000 lenses.</p>

<p>What is <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/javaongsan">Squidoo</a>?<br/>
<a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/javaongsan">Squidoo</a> is an easy-to-build, single web page that can point to blogs, favorite links, RSS feeds, Flickr photos, Google maps, your eBay auctions, CafePress designs, Amazon books or music, and more. <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/javaongsan">Squidoo</a> offers highly focused content which often rises to the top of the search engine rankings very quickly. <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/javaongsan">Squidoo</a> has a PR7 (Page Rank) in Google. According to Alexa, <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/javaongsan">Squidoo</a> is ranked in the top 1000 sites on the whole web. So <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/javaongsan">Squidoo</a> is really a powerful site for you to get exposure. You might want to use this to promote your new site or blog but I am going to talk about making money directly from it.</p>

<p>First there a few terms you need to get use to.<br/>
1. Lens<br/>
It&#8217;s an easy-to-build, single web page that can point to blogs, favorite links, RSS feeds, Flickr photos, Google maps, your eBay auctions, CafePress designs, Amazon books or music, and more.</p>

<hr />

<ol>
<li>Module<br/>
Modules are the building blocks of lenses. A module makes it easy to point to links, images, blogs or even things to buy. Modules can be content with html or rss feeds or  commerce-oriented.</li>
</ol>


<p>You can view a sample of my lens: <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/automatedtrafficmachine/">http://www.squidoo.com/automatedtrafficmachine/</a></p>

<p>How to make money?<br/>
You make money when visitors stops by your lens and buys a product you recommended or clicks on a Google ad, you get 50% of the royalties. If you don&#8217;t like money, select one of our 80+ nonprofit partners to donate these royalties to.</p>

<p>They mainly 2 types of payout here:<br/>
AdSense<br/>
This money goes into a pool, half of the pool distributes out to lensmasters, based on each lens&#8217;s average LensRank and traffic.</p>

<p>Affiliate revenue (ie, referral income&#8211;like Amazon and eBay and CafePress and SuperStore sales).<br/>
This is directly attributable to the lens that generated the revenue. The lensmaster gets a straight 50%.<br/>
Example, If your lens sells 1 book and Amazon pays us $1.05 in affiliate income, we send a nickel to charity and fifty cents to you.</p>

<p>Estimated earnings are shown on your MyLenses page you can view them everytime you logon.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/javaongsan">Squidoo</a> also have an referral scheme. Refer a friend to be a <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/javaongsan">Squidoo</a> lensmaster, when your friend&#8217;s lens earns its first $15, you AND your friend will each get $5, free!</p>

<p>How to build a successful lens?<br/>
1. Constant content updates<br/>
This can be easily done by including your blog&#8217;s rss feed to your lens. That way your lens is powered by your blog.<br/>
2. Join groups<br/>
There are very active groups that your lens can join within a smiliar niche<br/>
3. Use Plexo<br/>
Links, Amazon, Youtube and many more modules can be add as plexo. This allows other visitor to add their own links and vote their links up the ladder.<br/>
4. Traffic<br/>
The more traffic the more money.</p>

<p>This are some simple ways to build a lens. If you really want to be successful in <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/javaongsan">Squidoo</a> consider learning from one of the top <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/javaongsan">Squidoo</a> master around,  Bob Jenkins. <a href="http://www.squidoosecrets.com/build/?yourlens=2712">Squidoo Secrets<br/>
</a> are price at $47.</p>

<p>The basic idea of <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/javaongsan">Squidoo</a> is to make a many lens as possible, there no limits to the lens you can create. If you make $0.50 form 1 lens imagine what you have with 100 ens. The most important part is that its free, so <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/javaongsan">create you Squidoo account now </a>.</p>

I made used of the current promtion at the suntec PC Show to get myself a laptop. My weapon of choice, the Acer Aspire 5613WLMI. Intel Dual Core processor, 80g hardisk, 802.11b/g wireless and a bi 15.4 inch screen. It came with a bunch of freebies.</p>

<p>I being without a home PC or laptop for too long, maybe about 1 year. The new laptop takes a while to setup and came with almost nothing except for the OS which is vista. I hoping to get enough out of this laptop, for now I am happy with it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Its almost the end of the month, I decided to declare all my blog earnings early as I do not expect much changes.</p>

<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/23pnjg">payperpost</a> $74.51<br/>
<a href="http://www.bloggerwave.com/">bloggerwave</a> $30<br/>
<a href="http://sponsoredreviews.com">sponsoredreviews</a> Amount $9.75<br/>
adsense $18.02<br/>

<a href="http://automatedtrafficmachine.com/squidoosecrets/refer.html">suqidoo</a> $2.36<br/>
Affiliate Sales $27</p>

<p>Total is $164</p>

<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/23pnjg">payperpost</a> is my top income source, its also breaks down this way.<br/>
Amount To Be Paid for Post $44.51<br/>
Amount To Be Paid for Referrals: $15.00<br/>
Amount To Be Paid for &#8216;Review My Posts&#8217;: $15.00<br/>
So you not only make money from posting, but from referrals and reviews as well.</p>

<p>Not bad since I only take it seriously in May. My site hits average around 30 hits a day and highest day is only 54 hits. With 907 New Visits and 1,481 Pageviews in May, you can see that I really could make money from low traffic volume and is the reason why my adsense income is low. For my free traffic secret take a look at <a href="http://wizcoder.blogspot.com/2007/05/how-to-i-get-traffic-to-my-blog.html">How I get traffic to my blog?</a>.</p>

<p>Top post are <a href="http://wizcoder.blogspot.com/2007/05/how-to-i-get-traffic-to-my-blog.html">How I get traffic to my blog?</a> 48 hits and <a href="http://wizcoder.blogspot.com/2007/05/making-money-from-squidoo.html">Making Money from Squidoo</a> 47 hits.</p>

<p>I expect My income to grow exponentially when my PR and traffic goes up. My Goal for June is to make it pass $1000. Think I can do it?</p>

describe them to the community and return to them in the future.&#8221;</p>
