  <div class="entry-content"><p>Its almost the end of the month, I decided to declare all my blog earnings early as I do not expect much changes.</p>

<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/23pnjg">payperpost</a> $74.51<br/>
<a href="http://www.bloggerwave.com/">bloggerwave</a> $30<br/>
<a href="http://sponsoredreviews.com">sponsoredreviews</a> Amount $9.75<br/>
adsense $18.02<br/>
<a href="http://www.adbrite.com/mb/landing_both.php?spid=50200&amp;afb=125x125-1">AdBrite</a> $0.34<br/>

<a href="http://automatedtrafficmachine.com/squidoosecrets/refer.html">suqidoo</a> $2.36<br/>
Affiliate Sales $27</p>

<p>Total is $164</p>

<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/23pnjg">payperpost</a> is my top income source, its also breaks down this way.<br/>
Amount To Be Paid for Post $44.51<br/>
Amount To Be Paid for Referrals: $15.00<br/>
Amount To Be Paid for &#8216;Review My Posts&#8217;: $15.00<br/>
So you not only make money from posting, but from referrals and reviews as well.</p>

<p>Not bad since I only take it seriously in May. My site hits average around 30 hits a day and highest day is only 54 hits. With 907 New Visits and 1,481 Pageviews in May, you can see that I really could make money from low traffic volume and is the reason why my adsense income is low. For my free traffic secret take a look at <a href="http://wizcoder.blogspot.com/2007/05/how-to-i-get-traffic-to-my-blog.html">How I get traffic to my blog?</a>.</p>

<p>Top post are <a href="http://wizcoder.blogspot.com/2007/05/how-to-i-get-traffic-to-my-blog.html">How I get traffic to my blog?</a> 48 hits and <a href="http://wizcoder.blogspot.com/2007/05/making-money-from-squidoo.html">Making Money from Squidoo</a> 47 hits.</p>

<p>I expect My income to grow exponentially when my PR and traffic goes up. My Goal for June is to make it pass $1000. Think I can do it?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you are using word verification, you note that every first attempt to at word verfication is inccorrect. I believe this is due to the new autosave function, they simply did not update the word verification each time they autosave. This could be my browser problem, anyone else having problem with this?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When you post more than once a day, you probably need a lot of fresh ideas<br/>
for content. Generating content having cover by many top bloggers, here&#8217;s<br/>
what found that works for me.</p>

<p>Generating ideas<br/>
1. When I read article, listen to audios, watch A video, ideas come to<br/>
mind. I write them down.<br/>
2. Scan the internet for interesting topics, bookmark them. I categories<br/>
them carefully so that I remember the reason I bookmark them.<br/>
3. listen to what people are talking about in the public areas.</p>

<p>Tools<br/>
1. Always have a pen and paper ready. Carry a pocket size or a PDA with you<br/>
at all times, you don&#8217;t lose a good idea beause you can&#8217;t remember what it<br/>
was.<br/>
2. Use a voice recorder. Most phone have so make use of it.</p>

<p>One last point to note. Take down ideas, don&#8217;t jude then. It may not be a<br/>
good idea but who knows, it might in the future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I started blogging fulltime blogging only in May. Like any home based<br/>
business owner, I too struggle between getting my work done and enjoying<br/>
the comfort of my home.</p>

<p>In 2003, I ran a software development business from home for about 6<br/>
months, the toughest part was getting out of bed and getting motivated. In<br/>
the end, I have trade my freedom for a more discipline corporate life. This<br/>
time round, history are not likely to be repeated. I have gone through 3<br/>
years of personal development, education myself on time management, goal<br/>
setting, sales &amp; marketing, motivation and running unconventional<br/>
businesses.</p>

<p>I put together a 5 steps program to help you start a successful homebased<br/>
business<br/>
1. Dream<br/>
The single most important piece that could break or make your business. You<br/>
need a good reason for starting your business. It has to be so important<br/>
that you willing to risk your life for. List down every single reason and<br/>
be specific. A dream might be to spent more time with your kids, cos you<br/>
are so busy with work that you hardly see them.<br/>
2. The Action Plan<br/>
Here we want to convert your dreams to realistic goals. This is your game<br/>
plan. Set a dateline for your goal. A example of a goal might be, &#8220;I retire<br/>
on 27 june 2006 and spent lots of time with my children because I make 5<br/>
thousand dollars a month from my business&#8221;. Write down on a piece of paper<br/>
and struck where you will it everyday, like on your monitor.<br/>
3. Daily habits<br/>
Your goals needs to be translated to daily activities like a habit. For my<br/>
blog, it translates to how many post everyday by when, down to the minute,<br/>
reading up on related topics, researching, studying stats, generating a fix<br/>
amount of traffic, making a certain amount of sales etc.<br/>
4. Track and Measure<br/>
Nothing can be improve unless it can tracked. Record your work and results<br/>
everyday. I once hear a salesman record what he wore everyday, he will then<br/>
stick to those clothes that are bringing him results.<br/>
5. Don&#8217;t give up<br/>
The only reason why people failed In sports, work or businesses is simple<br/>
they gave up. If you keeping going, you get it done eventually.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>First impression are not only critical in our daily social but on your web<br/>
as well. To increase your readership, you will need to leave a good<br/>
impressions for the first time visitors. There a few things we can look at<br/>
to make your visitors fall for your blog.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Keep it simple<br/>
A unique and well design blog is critical whether its a free or self-hosted<br/>
blog. Simple layout with plain background. Dark text over white background<br/>
seems to be more attractive. Easy nagivation, on hand information are all<br/>
points to note.</p></li>
<li><p>Find a good host<br/>
If your hosting your own blog, find a good host with minimum downtime<br/>
record. If visitors come to site to find it down, they will not return.</p></li>
<li><p>Instant gratification<br/>
What the visitor wants the visitor gets. Show them what they looking for.<br/>
Make some of your top post readily available via link list. Organise your<br/>
tags, and make archives available.</p></li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was surprising to log on to <a href="http://automatedtrafficmachine.com/squidoosecrets/refer.html">suqidoo</a> and find that my lens had make a few dollars in the last period. <a href="http://automatedtrafficmachine.com/squidoosecrets/refer.html">Squidoo</a>was mostly used to drive traffic, an alternative to climb up the serach engine rank, as I did <a href="http://wizcoder.blogspot.com/search/label/squidoo">here</a>. It was never a way to make money, however it turns out it could be a good alternative.</p>

<p>You can recycle some of your blog article as a lens. If your blog is update frequently, your squid benefits as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If look closely on the left sidebar, you notice a widget name &#8220;mybloglog recent visitor&#8221;. Mybloglog is a web 2.0 blog social network. Its free and you get to lost all your blogs. Any member who likes your blog would be<br/>
able to join your blog community.</p>

<p>To draw visitors, you visit their blogs and leave comment on their community. However, I believe the success rate is very low. In order to be successful on <a href="http://www.mybloglog.com/buzz/members/wizcoder/">mybloglog</a>, you need a decent photo of yourself, not an object or cartoon, no studio photo as well. A good user name no weird, funny or sleazy ones, nothing associated with money. Next you start checking out <a href="http://www.mybloglog.com/buzz/members/wizcoder/">mybloglog</a> members and their blog. I run through at least a hundred of them per day. Most of them will start visiting your blog and community. There&#8217;s<br/>
nothing more exciting than getting new faces on the widget everyday.</p>

<p>The other great thing is that mybloglog has a statistical link for blog, which monitors your stats. There&#8217;s a widget that ranks the top 5 most clicked link. You be able to see where your visitors are clicking on. I use<br/>
this to change my affliate products on my blog. I put up a link to a product test it for 3 days, if its good it stays, if not I try another.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mybloglog.com/buzz/members/wizcoder/">mybloglog</a> is own by yahoo, and they have a lot of potential. Another features of <a href="http://www.mybloglog.com/buzz/members/wizcoder/">mybloglog</a> is that if you visit a blog for a number of time, you be added to their community, you can use thos features to get<br/>
more members.</p>
