  <div class="entry-content"><p>I started blogging fulltime blogging only in May. Like any home based<br/>
business owner, I too struggle between getting my work done and enjoying<br/>
the comfort of my home.</p>

<p>In 2003, I ran a software development business from home for about 6<br/>
months, the toughest part was getting out of bed and getting motivated. In<br/>
the end, I have trade my freedom for a more discipline corporate life. This<br/>
time round, history are not likely to be repeated. I have gone through 3<br/>
years of personal development, education myself on time management, goal<br/>
setting, sales &amp; marketing, motivation and running unconventional<br/>
businesses.</p>

<p>I put together a 5 steps program to help you start a successful homebased<br/>
business<br/>
1. Dream<br/>
The single most important piece that could break or make your business. You<br/>
need a good reason for starting your business. It has to be so important<br/>
that you willing to risk your life for. List down every single reason and<br/>
be specific. A dream might be to spent more time with your kids, cos you<br/>
are so busy with work that you hardly see them.<br/>
2. The Action Plan<br/>
Here we want to convert your dreams to realistic goals. This is your game<br/>
plan. Set a dateline for your goal. A example of a goal might be, &#8220;I retire<br/>
on 27 june 2006 and spent lots of time with my children because I make 5<br/>
thousand dollars a month from my business&#8221;. Write down on a piece of paper<br/>
and struck where you will it everyday, like on your monitor.<br/>
3. Daily habits<br/>
Your goals needs to be translated to daily activities like a habit. For my<br/>
blog, it translates to how many post everyday by when, down to the minute,<br/>
reading up on related topics, researching, studying stats, generating a fix<br/>
amount of traffic, making a certain amount of sales etc.<br/>
4. Track and Measure<br/>
Nothing can be improve unless it can tracked. Record your work and results<br/>
everyday. I once hear a salesman record what he wore everyday, he will then<br/>
stick to those clothes that are bringing him results.<br/>
5. Don&#8217;t give up<br/>
The only reason why people failed In sports, work or businesses is simple<br/>
they gave up. If you keeping going, you get it done eventually.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>First impression are not only critical in our daily social but on your web<br/>
as well. To increase your readership, you will need to leave a good<br/>
impressions for the first time visitors. There a few things we can look at<br/>
to make your visitors fall for your blog.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Keep it simple<br/>
A unique and well design blog is critical whether its a free or self-hosted<br/>
blog. Simple layout with plain background. Dark text over white background<br/>
seems to be more attractive. Easy nagivation, on hand information are all<br/>
points to note.</p></li>
<li><p>Find a good host<br/>
If your hosting your own blog, find a good host with minimum downtime<br/>
record. If visitors come to site to find it down, they will not return.</p></li>
<li><p>Instant gratification<br/>
What the visitor wants the visitor gets. Show them what they looking for.<br/>
Make some of your top post readily available via link list. Organise your<br/>
tags, and make archives available.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was surprising to log on to <a href="http://automatedtrafficmachine.com/squidoosecrets/refer.html">suqidoo</a> and find that my lens had make a few dollars in the last period. <a href="http://automatedtrafficmachine.com/squidoosecrets/refer.html">Squidoo</a>was mostly used to drive traffic, an alternative to climb up the serach engine rank, as I did <a href="http://wizcoder.blogspot.com/search/label/squidoo">here</a>. It was never a way to make money, however it turns out it could be a good alternative.</p>

<p>You can recycle some of your blog article as a lens. If your blog is update frequently, your squid benefits as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If look closely on the left sidebar, you notice a widget name &#8220;mybloglog recent visitor&#8221;. Mybloglog is a web 2.0 blog social network. Its free and you get to lost all your blogs. Any member who likes your blog would be<br/>
able to join your blog community.</p>

<p>To draw visitors, you visit their blogs and leave comment on their community. However, I believe the success rate is very low. In order to be successful on <a href="http://www.mybloglog.com/buzz/members/wizcoder/">mybloglog</a>, you need a decent photo of yourself, not an object or cartoon, no studio photo as well. A good user name no weird, funny or sleazy ones, nothing associated with money. Next you start checking out <a href="http://www.mybloglog.com/buzz/members/wizcoder/">mybloglog</a> members and their blog. I run through at least a hundred of them per day. Most of them will start visiting your blog and community. There&#8217;s<br/>
nothing more exciting than getting new faces on the widget everyday.</p>

<p>The other great thing is that mybloglog has a statistical link for blog, which monitors your stats. There&#8217;s a widget that ranks the top 5 most clicked link. You be able to see where your visitors are clicking on. I use<br/>
this to change my affliate products on my blog. I put up a link to a product test it for 3 days, if its good it stays, if not I try another.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mybloglog.com/buzz/members/wizcoder/">mybloglog</a> is own by yahoo, and they have a lot of potential. Another features of <a href="http://www.mybloglog.com/buzz/members/wizcoder/">mybloglog</a> is that if you visit a blog for a number of time, you be added to their community, you can use thos features to get<br/>
more members.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Regardless of where your traffic are from, you need to direct them to<br/>
specific area of your blog. Instead of pointing to your main index, you<br/>
should experiment by sending your traffic to some of your better post. You<br/>
be surprise with the increase return rate. Sometime you write a off topic<br/>
post, if you sent your traffic to your mian page using your main topoc<br/>
keywords, visitors might leave once they do get the information they are<br/>
after.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Beside traffic strategy online, what can we do to get traffic from offline<br/>
sources. Well for a blog I recong we shloudn&#8217;t be paying, we definitely<br/>
looking for free advertising.</p>

<p>I list a few strategy:<br/>
Contributing articles to newspapers and magazines. Like online submission<br/>
you can reuse your blog articles. Added an author bio with your blog url.<br/>
Getting interview on papers, magazine, tv, or radio. In this case, you will<br/>
need some creditibilty in your niche.<br/>
Viral spread it among friends and families.<br/>
Networking daily, at seminars, function, any chances you have to meet<br/>
people. You need a name card. It dosent have to be a card with nice logo,<br/>
mission statements etc. You need a card that have your name, email, phone<br/>
number and most importantly your website url<br/>
Noticeboards, they are everywhere bustops, trainstation, schools,<br/>
supermarts.<br/>
Some magazines and papers circlulated at a smaller scale, offers free<br/>
classified sections.<br/>
Print pamphlets from your own printers and hand them out at high human<br/>
traffic areas.<br/>
Use your car as a walking advertisement. Put up visible ads on your side<br/>
doors, boot and rear windows</p>

<p>Beside this few ideas, you can be creative and come up with unique ways of<br/>
prompting your blog.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Blog template are the most crucial piece of the parcel. Like a person, the<br/>
first impression is important, most visitors like myself jude a blog by its<br/>
layout.</p>

<p>Most template from wordpress, blogger, or any other platform is too common.<br/>
When I come across with same template, I might mistaken it as a blog I seen<br/>
before. Most header are too big, it fills up 80% of my browser. When I am<br/>
lazy to scroll, I might just leave the site.</p>

<p>Investing time to create your own layout definitely separate yourself from<br/>
others. A few points I taken from other and my blog. Keep your header small<br/>
with no ads near it, top or bottom. The more crowded the layout the more<br/>
popular. Regardless of what web design classes have thought us, it seem<br/>
that a less clean layout enjoys more success and makes more money. I have<br/>
more success with this template than any cleaner ones that I used. Loading<br/>
time is a consent for me, test ads and widgets, make sure there are not<br/>
taking up most the bandwidth. Only used light weight widgets and ad<br/>
networks.</p>

<p>The most important task is testing. Always make it a point to test and<br/>
measure, that&#8217;s the best way to find the most profitable template.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>this post is from my o2, so let me warn you in advance, it won&#8217;t be pretty.<br/>
if you are struggling to read 10-50or more rss feeds everyday, i got a<br/>
quick tip for u.</p>

<p>first of all, you need read up on post on hacking firefox for a better rss<br/>
reader. most rss readers are formated like emails, thus effort needed to<br/>
quick on each feed, each header. my hack allows you to see a list of header<br/>
with a extract of the post, so at one glance yoi see how many new post and<br/>
scan through them quickly.</p>

<p>next you need to arrange your feeds in 3 category, top which is author who<br/>
post daily and more than once, mid are those who post once a day. low, once<br/>
every few day<br/>
create a folder for each of them. everyday, You go through the folders from<br/>
low to high. use the open all tabs from firefox, it will open all the feed<br/>
in that folder. glance through all the header, if header interest you,<br/>
read the short description, click on those that you want to read, bookmark<br/>
them. once you go through all the feeds, you open all the articles you have<br/>
bookmark in tabs and go through tHem.</p>

<p>ok now, this tips is for firefox user only, for ie user you be able to find<br/>
the download button on the top of my page. the best part its works better<br/>
than ie and its free</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Making money from blogging depends a lot on the traffic you get. The more traffic the more profitable your blog. The number one question on every blogger&#8217;s mind is &#8220;How to I get traffic to my blog?&#8221;</p>

<p>Here are some strategy I use. When you developed a good strategy for creating traffic, you get ever increasing traffic.</p>

<p>Before Starting your traffic campaign, you should have a way to measure your traffic performances. Try Google Analytics, its one of the best free tool.</p>

<ol>
<li>SEO, get you website listed in the search engines for specific keywords that relate to your website. Brush up your <a href="http://wizcoder.blogspot.com/2007/03/basic-seo-advice.html">SEO Basics</a>.</li>
<li>Use PPC (Pay Per Click) such as Google Adwords.</li>
<li>Free Traffic Exhanges. Try this:

<pre><code>     1. [trafficswarm](http://www.trafficswarm.com/go.cgi?606508)
     2. [trafficroundup](http://www.trafficroundup.com/newuser.php?ref=javaongsan)

</code></pre></li>
<li>Post on forums similar to your niche, and have a link in your forum signature file.</li>
<li>Email to your friends tell them about your blog</li>
<li>Recycle your blog post as articles and have them posted on Article Directories.</li>
<li>Some good article directories to get you started:

<pre><code>       1. [www.eZineArticles.com](http://www.ezinearticles.com/)
       2. [www.ultimatearticledirectory.com](http://www.ultimatearticledirectory.com/)

</code></pre></li>
<li>Link Exchange from other sites.</li>
<li>Create links to your blog from web 2.0 social networking sites.</li>
<li>blog and ping. Basically, when you update your blog, you can let blog portals such as <a href="http://technorati.com/">technorati.com</a> know by pinging them. You can ping a lot of portals at once by using  <a href="http://pingomatic.com/">pingomatic.com</a>.</li>
<li>Interactions Between with other Blogs.</li>
</ol>


<p>Try something every day that will help increase the traffic to your blog.</p>
