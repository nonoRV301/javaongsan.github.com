  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wrote about the 3 type of browser available for windows mobile and pocket pc devices previously. I tested <a href="www.opera.com/products/mobile">opera</a> on o2 atom. Normal Browsing was good, javascript supported, the screen resolution was better than pocket internet explorer. However going to bogger beta is stop because of cookie issues. Opera supports cookies but did not work for blogger. I am using opera beta version which is available till June.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have my 02 atom for almost a year now. Its a useful phone pda except for its ability to browse the web. The Pocket Internet Explorer  are not able to  view javascript or flash. I tried to post from my 02, the basic functions are there, however the publishing button does not response. The only blogging mobile client available are only for typepad. Wordpress has a interface special for mobile devices.</p>

<p>To blog from blogger you have purchase a browse that supports javascript. They are Netfont, Thunderhawk or opera. No client have been build mainly because google do not have the authenication api available.</p>

<p>The work around is to use email to blog, you have set at email id with blogger, then post to this address with text only. However if some else get hold of that email address, they can post to your blog.</p>

<p>If theres any blogging client that allows me to post to blogger and free, I would like to know about it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>An rss feed is simply an XML formated document of your blog. Most Blog comes with a default rss feed. However these feed are not display on the blog itself, you need to enable or use a script and image to display it.</p>

<p>You need a rss feed cos most reader preferable to read a number of blog at once using rss readers like google reader, yahoo, netvibes, blogline etc. To cater for all this feed reader you can choose to go to each of the readers to get the code to be place on your blog. An easier way to do this is via <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">feedburner</a>. Get an account on <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">feedburner</a>, and follow the simple instruction to set up your feeds. Feedburner allows you to set up individual reader&#8217;s feed, but I use a general feed because its looks cleaner and it works with all the readers.</p>

<p>After setting up your feedburner, you need to ping the various type of readers to inform them of you latest posting. This can be done by using software, a good way is by <a href="http://pingomatic.com/">pingomatic.</a></p>

<p>Your rss feed is a good way to get up the search engine, as  I mention in my previous <a href="http://wizcoder.blogspot.com/2007/03/making-money-from-blogging-feedburner.html">post</a><a href="http://wizcoder.blogspot.com/2007/03/making-money-from-blogging-feedburner.html">.</a><br/>
My feed is currently number 3 on yahoo for the keyword &#8220;Making Money for blogging&#8221;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What type of content that is suitable for your blog in order to make it profitable. First off, I want you to understand that there is no fixed scope that your blog should have, which means you can write about whatever you’re interested in.</p>

<p>However, the difference between a profitable blog and a non-profitable blog is the way the blog is written. Just imagine, would you prefer to read your university professor’s lecture notes or the latest novel by your favourite author?</p>

<p>You may prefer to read the novel because it appeals more to your interest, or because it is not as mind-numbing as the lecture notes by your professor. However, the most important point is people like to read “light” stuff most of the time. You see, when people log on to your blog, they are not only looking for information – they are also looking for information they can obtain easily, and better still in a relaxed manner.</p>

<p>So, to attract more visitors as well as to keep your current visitors coming back for more, it is very important to add a human touch to your blog posts. This can be done by simply imagining you’re talking about a certain topic with your personal friend. An extra bonus for your readers would be a great sense of humour, so try to add funny comments in your articles where they are suitable.</p>

<p>Another important key point is to avoid addressing your reader as a plural unit. What I really mean is you should not write as if you’re preparing a speech. Instead, you should write as if you’re having a conversation to a single person because this will make your visitor think of you more as a personal friend rather than a person of higher authority.</p>

<p>Besides that, it is also very useful to establish your own personality through your words. Human beings are very curious creatures, so naturally your visitors would want to know as much about you as the information you’re offering them.</p>

<p>Having a distinctive personality in your blog would make a world’s difference between your blog about gadgets and all the other blogs about gadgets out there. This is a lot like creating your own brand name, where people immediately remember your blog’s name when they need to find out information about gadgets, just like how people immediately think of McDonald’s for fastfood or Nike for sportswear.</p>

<p>So, the lesson for today is to simply write as an equal friend to your visitors, write to them as if you’re talking to a single person and establish your own personality on your blog.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>As your blog grew, people in your niche will definitely mention your blog. This is seen as an initiation of an interaction. When people speak of you, you should thank them for the mention and build up the interaction!</p>

<p>When you use a traffic tracking script such as the Google analytics, you can see where traffic comes from. If a large number of visitors come from a certain blog, you can be sure they have mentioned you in their latest post or linked to you from their sidebar or links page. What you should do is pay them a visit, leave constructive comments on their posts and build up a conversation!</p>

<p>As you continue doing this, you will start to gather a lot of friends in your niche. This is helpful later on when you decide to do collaborations such as interviews. In fact, when you’re out of ideas for writing on your blog, you can interview other blog owners in your niche! Human beings are curious creatures, so naturally they would like to know more about a person whose writings they read so often.</p>

<p>If you’re using Wordpress you can also post trackback links on your posts. This means you can post an article about what other people have posted! Your particular post will then appear as a link on that post you have written about. This is definitely a great way to get traffic if you post brilliant insights about a post on a very famous blog. Since the famous blog already has a per-existing pool of readers, this is like a shortcut to hog their visitors! The only thing you would want to observe is to keep your posts sensible and insightful, or you’ll be viewed as a spammer.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you’re using Blogger, you would not be able to use trackback links. However, you can post insightful comments on other people’s blogs and subtly include a link back to your blog. You can make it seem like you’re pointing to your blog as an extra reference to the subject of discussion. Of course, this technique is not only limited to Blogger users and users of other blog engines can employ this strategy as an additional traffic source.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Basic SEO advice</p>

<p>**What anyone could do for their websites</p>

<p><em>article by Googlerankings.com staff, 06.11.2004.</em>**</p>

<p>While</p>

<pre><code>  this document will not guarantee top placement for you in any search engines,  
  it will increase your chances to be included in the relevant results.  
  Consider the information below to be subjective advice, and advice only,  
  which have been assembled based on both experience and research. Please  
  note that all search engine technologies are constantly evolving, rendering  
  only month-old tricks to deceive their methods useless. The only way to  
  keep your website at a proper place of search results is - as general  
  it sounds - providing content that people are both interested in and are  
  looking for.
</code></pre>

<p>In</p>

<pre><code>  general, search engines have been designed by people who are skilled at  
  gathering, storing and analyzing data, programmers, mathematicians and  
  other talented people with innovative ideas. However in the age when nearly  
  anyone in the free world can access the internet, the ratio of people  
  used to handling raw information have rapidly decreased. In other words,  
</code></pre>

<p>**most people do not think about information the way search engine designers</p>

<pre><code>  would**.  




  Search engine optimization ( SEO ) is the bridge over the gap, it is to  
  bring people with average computer skills, and the information they look  
  for together. It overlaps the sometimes still too mathematics-based search  
  engine technology, and takes you a step closer to your target audience.  
  SEO should be about examining how people are looking up information on  
  the web, and not how you may trick them into visiting your website. 
</code></pre>

<h5>1.: Choosing your Keywords</h5>

<ul>
<li><p>A research done</p>

<pre><code>by [Entireweb](http://www.entireweb.com/)  
31% of people enter 2 word phrases into search engines, 25% of all users  
look for 3 word combinations and only about 19% of them try their luck  
with only a single word.
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Do not choose a</p>

<pre><code>keyword to optimize your site for that you don't have the slightest  
chance of ranking good with because of the fierce competition.
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Do not choose a</p>

<pre><code>keyword that nobody looks for.
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Do not choose a</p>

<pre><code>keyword that does not relate strongly enough to your content.
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Only use generally</p>

<pre><code>popular keywords if you do not need targeted traffic.
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Do not use words</p>

<pre><code>that may get your site filtered or banned from search engines.
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Do not use images</p>

<pre><code>with filenames or ALT tags ( Alt attributes of IMG tag ) that may get  
your site filtered or banned from search engines.
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Only use dynamic</p>

<pre><code>pages when the functionality demands it.
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Use lots of relevant</p>

<pre><code>content, well laid out into separate pages.
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>For best results</p>

<pre><code>optimize one page for one keyword.
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Do not post half-finished</p>

<pre><code>sites.
</code></pre></li>
</ul>


<h5>2.: HTML</h5>

<blockquote><p>**2.1.:</p>

<pre><code>    Tag**
</code></pre></blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>The title should</p>

<pre><code>not be any longer than 70-100 characters, including spaces. ( Google  
- DMOZ )
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The title should</p>

<pre><code>bot be any longer than 60 characters. ( scrubtheweb.com )
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The title should</p>

<pre><code>not begin with the domain name. It is often considered as spam.
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The domain name</p>

<pre><code>shouldn't be repeated in the title. It is often considered as spam.
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Do not use the</p>

<pre><code>same filename as the title tag, or the same filename as the domain name.  
It is often considered as spam.  
</code></pre></li>
</ul>


<p>**2.2.:</p>

<pre><code>      Description&gt; Tag**
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>Shouldn&#8217;t be any</p>

<pre><code>longer than 25-30 words ( DMOZ ).
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Shouldn&#8217;t be any</p>

<pre><code>longer than 100 characters ( Google ).
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Shouldn&#8217;t be any</p>

<pre><code>longer than 150 characters ( scrubtheweb.com ).
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Shouldn&#8217;t be any</p>

<pre><code>longer than 200 characters ( searchenginewatch.com referring to Google  
).  
</code></pre></li>
</ul>


<p>**2.3.:</p>

<pre><code>      Keywords&gt; Tag**
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>Shouldn&#8217;t be any</p>

<pre><code>longer than 268 characters ( AltaVista ).
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Shouldn&#8217;t be any</p>

<pre><code>longer than 378 characters ( searchenginewatch.com referring to Google  
).
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>You should not</p>

<pre><code>use words that are not present in the body of the page.
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Redundant characters</p>

<pre><code>will not hurt overall results, however words after the first 300 characters  
rarely do any good.
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Start all keywords</p>

<pre><code>with capital letters.( Relevant only on alphabetical listings )
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Separate keywords</p>

<pre><code>with the ", " ( comma, space ) character combination. ( Most  
search engines use either character as the separator ).
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>You may use phrases</p>

<pre><code>as well.
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>You should not</p>

<pre><code>use any word, not even within phrases more than 3 times. It is often  
considered as spam.
</code></pre></li>
</ul>


<h5>3.: Content</h5>

<ul>
<li><p>The text on the</p>

<pre><code>page should contain the keywords right at the beginning of the page.
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Do not overuse</p>

<pre><code>keywords. Neither keyword should take up more than 12-24% of the entire  
body text. It is often considered as spam.
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Do not use too</p>

<pre><code>much content right on the front page. Both loading time and redundancy  
of additional words used will reduce the chance of showing up in relevant  
searches.
</code></pre></li>
</ul>


<h5>4.: HTML Code Page</h5>

<ul>
<li><p>In case your website</p>

<pre><code>uses a language different than the default of the search engine which  
your target audience prefers, or your website uses special characters  
unique to that language, make sure to implement the proper HTML codepage  
tag.
</code></pre></li>

<p>**5.: Search Engine</p>

<pre><code>  Basics**
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>Search engines</p>

<pre><code>operate by funds as well. Funds are collected either from selling advertisement  
placement, selling listings, or both. When a search engine company sells  
out the area above the search results as advertisement space, and displays  
only relevant results based on what the users were looking for, most  
people will be mislead by the placement of such links, and choose them  
instead of the actual results.
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Search engines</p>

<pre><code>that operate by funds generated by selling listings will not show your  
website within the results regardless of its relevance, unless you sign  
up for their service.
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>You may be listed</p>

<pre><code>for free even on fee based search engines by getting your site listed  
on either of the directories the search engine company buys information  
from. However, such directories such as [Yahoo.com](http://www.yahoo.com/)  
and [DMOZ.org](http://www.dmoz.org/) are  
moderated based on relevance and content, thus getting listed on their  
websites may take some time and efforts.
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Most search engines</p>

<pre><code>rank your website by relevance, which is measured by the thresold of  
keywords.
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Some search engines,</p>

<pre><code>such as Google.com as well, will sort even relevant sites by their popularity,  
measuring the page rank by the actual links leading to the site. Also,  
the text or ALT TAG text accompanied with these links will influence  
the keywords the website is shown in the listings for.
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Some search engines</p>

<pre><code>will consider a website more and more popular when they are clicked  
on the results page. These inlude [AltaVista.com](http://www.altavista.com/)  
.

<pre><code>  it, but do everything you can
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>Eventhough META</p>

<pre><code>tags have been neglected by most major search engines, some of them  
still consider them when analyzing websites. Including them in the proper  
manner can only help, but will never hurt your position.
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>When trying to</p>

<pre><code>trick search engines, you try to trick their creators, who are more  
than prepared to deal with this.
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Most search engines</p>

<pre><code>are updated at least annually to deal with the websites that found a  
way to deceive their systems.  

Most of the websites that have ever used such tactics get blacklisted.
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>In order to allow</p>

<pre><code>web-spiders ( analyzing programs that surf the net and categorise websites  
) to inspect all of your webpages, place a file named "robots.txt"

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I often meet new Internet marketers seminars and they aspire to earn the big bucks like some of the well-known Internet Marketers. However, most of these new marketers have only the slightest ideas on where to start, and a lot of them are not willing or able to invest a startup capital in their online business. However, it is almost impossible to start an Internet business without spending some money on basic infrastructure such as web hosting, domain names and so on. Hence, here is a rough guide on how to build an Internet business starting with $0.</p>

<p>The first and most important thing to do is to list out all your skills, knowledge and abilities. What skills do you have? You may have picked up these skills through daily life (for example languages), through your job (hands-on knowledge on a specific niche), what do people come to you for advice about or from your hobbies (for example fishing). It is most vital to list down skills or knowledge that you have and might be in demand elsewhere. For example, you love to play video games why not build your Internet business upon this: writing an instructional guide on how to play better, hidden tips, etc. Best of all, you do not need to spend money to acquire this knowledge: you already have it.</p>

<p>So, the very first option, if you have no money to start off your online business, is to earn some capital using your already existing skills or knowledge. You can give tuition to students on your dominant subject in college, you can teach stuff about your hobby to people who are interested, you can write guides on knowledge or skills you picked up through experience and cannot be found in theoretical books.</p>

<p>Okay, let&#8217;s say if you just can&#8217;t think of any skills or knowledge that people might be interested in. Then, it&#8217;s most important that you locate a workable business model and focus on that alone. You can obtain almost everything you need through bartering, web hosting, domain name or credit card processing, to name a few in exchange for your product (if you own one) or services like copywriting, ghostwriting and website designs. There is always some mundane job that people don&#8217;t want to do, and you can do that for those people in exchange for things you need. You just need to ask for it!</p>
