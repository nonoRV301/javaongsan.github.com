  <div class="entry-content"><p>this post is from my o2, so let me warn you in advance, it won&#8217;t be pretty.<br/>
if you are struggling to read 10-50or more rss feeds everyday, i got a<br/>
quick tip for u.</p>

<p>first of all, you need read up on post on hacking firefox for a better rss<br/>
reader. most rss readers are formated like emails, thus effort needed to<br/>
quick on each feed, each header. my hack allows you to see a list of header<br/>
with a extract of the post, so at one glance yoi see how many new post and<br/>
scan through them quickly.</p>

<p>next you need to arrange your feeds in 3 category, top which is author who<br/>
post daily and more than once, mid are those who post once a day. low, once<br/>
every few day<br/>
create a folder for each of them. everyday, You go through the folders from<br/>
low to high. use the open all tabs from firefox, it will open all the feed<br/>
in that folder. glance through all the header, if header interest you,<br/>
read the short description, click on those that you want to read, bookmark<br/>
them. once you go through all the feeds, you open all the articles you have<br/>
bookmark in tabs and go through tHem.</p>

<p>ok now, this tips is for firefox user only, for ie user you be able to find<br/>
the download button on the top of my page. the best part its works better<br/>
than ie and its free</p>

<p>Before Starting your traffic campaign, you should have a way to measure your traffic performances. Try Google Analytics, its one of the best free tool.</p>

<ol>
<li>SEO, get you website listed in the search engines for specific keywords that relate to your website. Brush up your <a href="http://wizcoder.blogspot.com/2007/03/basic-seo-advice.html">SEO Basics</a>.</li>
<li>Use PPC (Pay Per Click) such as Google Adwords.</li>
<li>Free Traffic Exhanges. Try this:

<pre><code>     1. [trafficswarm](http://www.trafficswarm.com/go.cgi?606508)
     2. [trafficroundup](http://www.trafficroundup.com/newuser.php?ref=javaongsan)

</code></pre></li>
<li>Post on forums similar to your niche, and have a link in your forum signature file.</li>
<li>Email to your friends tell them about your blog</li>
<li>Recycle your blog post as articles and have them posted on Article Directories.</li>

       2. [www.ultimatearticledirectory.com](http://www.ultimatearticledirectory.com/)

</code></pre></li>
<li>Link Exchange from other sites.</li>
<li>Create links to your blog from web 2.0 social networking sites.</li>
<li>blog and ping. Basically, when you update your blog, you can let blog portals such as <a href="http://technorati.com/">technorati.com</a> know by pinging them. You can ping a lot of portals at once by using  <a href="http://pingomatic.com/">pingomatic.com</a>.</li>

I tested <a href="www.opera.com/products/mobile">opera</a> on o2 atom. Normal Browsing was good, javascript supported, the screen resolution was better than pocket internet explorer. However going to bogger beta is stop because of cookie issues. Opera supports cookies but did not work for blogger. I am using opera beta version which is available till June.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have my 02 atom for almost a year now. Its a useful phone pda except for its ability to browse the web. The Pocket Internet Explorer  are not able to  view javascript or flash. I tried to post from my 02, the basic functions are there, however the publishing button does not response. The only blogging mobile client available are only for typepad. Wordpress has a interface special for mobile devices.</p>

<p>To blog from blogger you have purchase a browse that supports javascript. They are Netfont, Thunderhawk or opera. No client have been build mainly because google do not have the authenication api available.</p>

<p>The work around is to use email to blog, you have set at email id with blogger, then post to this address with text only. However if some else get hold of that email address, they can post to your blog.</p>

<p>If theres any blogging client that allows me to post to blogger and free, I would like to know about it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>An rss feed is simply an XML formated document of your blog. Most Blog comes with a default rss feed. However these feed are not display on the blog itself, you need to enable or use a script and image to display it.</p>

<p>You need a rss feed cos most reader preferable to read a number of blog at once using rss readers like google reader, yahoo, netvibes, blogline etc. To cater for all this feed reader you can choose to go to each of the readers to get the code to be place on your blog. An easier way to do this is via <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">feedburner</a>. Get an account on <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">feedburner</a>, and follow the simple instruction to set up your feeds. Feedburner allows you to set up individual reader&#8217;s feed, but I use a general feed because its looks cleaner and it works with all the readers.</p>

<p>After setting up your feedburner, you need to ping the various type of readers to inform them of you latest posting. This can be done by using software, a good way is by <a href="http://pingomatic.com/">pingomatic.</a></p>

<p>Your rss feed is a good way to get up the search engine, as  I mention in my previous <a href="http://wizcoder.blogspot.com/2007/03/making-money-from-blogging-feedburner.html">post</a><a href="http://wizcoder.blogspot.com/2007/03/making-money-from-blogging-feedburner.html">.</a><br/>
My feed is currently number 3 on yahoo for the keyword &#8220;Making Money for blogging&#8221;.</p>

      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What type of content that is suitable for your blog in order to make it profitable. First off, I want you to understand that there is no fixed scope that your blog should have, which means you can write about whatever you’re interested in.</p>

<p>However, the difference between a profitable blog and a non-profitable blog is the way the blog is written. Just imagine, would you prefer to read your university professor’s lecture notes or the latest novel by your favourite author?</p>

<p>You may prefer to read the novel because it appeals more to your interest, or because it is not as mind-numbing as the lecture notes by your professor. However, the most important point is people like to read “light” stuff most of the time. You see, when people log on to your blog, they are not only looking for information – they are also looking for information they can obtain easily, and better still in a relaxed manner.</p>

<p>So, to attract more visitors as well as to keep your current visitors coming back for more, it is very important to add a human touch to your blog posts. This can be done by simply imagining you’re talking about a certain topic with your personal friend. An extra bonus for your readers would be a great sense of humour, so try to add funny comments in your articles where they are suitable.</p>

<p>Another important key point is to avoid addressing your reader as a plural unit. What I really mean is you should not write as if you’re preparing a speech. Instead, you should write as if you’re having a conversation to a single person because this will make your visitor think of you more as a personal friend rather than a person of higher authority.</p>

<p>Besides that, it is also very useful to establish your own personality through your words. Human beings are very curious creatures, so naturally your visitors would want to know as much about you as the information you’re offering them.</p>

<p>Having a distinctive personality in your blog would make a world’s difference between your blog about gadgets and all the other blogs about gadgets out there. This is a lot like creating your own brand name, where people immediately remember your blog’s name when they need to find out information about gadgets, just like how people immediately think of McDonald’s for fastfood or Nike for sportswear.</p>

<p>So, the lesson for today is to simply write as an equal friend to your visitors, write to them as if you’re talking to a single person and establish your own personality on your blog.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As your blog grew, people in your niche will definitely mention your blog. This is seen as an initiation of an interaction. When people speak of you, you should thank them for the mention and build up the interaction!</p>

<p>When you use a traffic tracking script such as the Google analytics, you can see where traffic comes from. If a large number of visitors come from a certain blog, you can be sure they have mentioned you in their latest post or linked to you from their sidebar or links page. What you should do is pay them a visit, leave constructive comments on their posts and build up a conversation!</p>

<p>As you continue doing this, you will start to gather a lot of friends in your niche. This is helpful later on when you decide to do collaborations such as interviews. In fact, when you’re out of ideas for writing on your blog, you can interview other blog owners in your niche! Human beings are curious creatures, so naturally they would like to know more about a person whose writings they read so often.</p>

<p>If you’re using Wordpress you can also post trackback links on your posts. This means you can post an article about what other people have posted! Your particular post will then appear as a link on that post you have written about. This is definitely a great way to get traffic if you post brilliant insights about a post on a very famous blog. Since the famous blog already has a per-existing pool of readers, this is like a shortcut to hog their visitors! The only thing you would want to observe is to keep your posts sensible and insightful, or you’ll be viewed as a spammer.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you’re using Blogger, you would not be able to use trackback links. However, you can post insightful comments on other people’s blogs and subtly include a link back to your blog. You can make it seem like you’re pointing to your blog as an extra reference to the subject of discussion. Of course, this technique is not only limited to Blogger users and users of other blog engines can employ this strategy as an additional traffic source.</p>
