  <div class="entry-content"><p>As of 2sst Sep 2006 12:36 AM, My 17&#8217; GT Avalanche 2.0 2005 and I are offically separated. After posting her availablity online, She left at midnight with an SMU student. I am sad to see her leave and wish her happiness with her new parthner. We have been together since Aug 05. We participated in KL AXN urban Challenge 05, OSiM Tri and NUS Tri. Compatiblity is the main reason for our separation.</p>

<p>Its a good day. The sky was clear and the weather was cool. I drove down to ECP at 11:20 my wave starts at 12:15. Once reached I went for body marking. Had to look around for the tent, the station are not really well placed and mark. Saw some my friends who had finish their 500m and 1500m swims.</p>

<p>About 12pm I went for my warm up swim. The current felt smooth and water was cool.<br/>
The race starts at 12:15 sharp. I was starting on the left for the first time, normally i go to the right. As expected I was caughtin the human jam right from the start. I started with freestlye move to the first boyle turn right everything felt ok. At the last turn heading towards shore, I start to drift away, the current was pushing me away, I end up a few 100m away from. I couldnt orientate using freestyle.</p>

<p>I switch to breaststroke for the 2nd and third round, I could feel myself slowing down. At the end of the third round my watch read 50min+. I couldnt believe it, the last time i did 1500m my timming was 34min. I had to put in some extra effort. I swam free style mix with breast for the 4th and 5th round.</p>

<p>On the 4th round I got stung by somthing, i didnt see what but it cause a sharp pain on my right shoulder. I was afriad I might get dizzy but nothing much happen so i continued. The last round I knew I would be the last there was only a 3 people running towards the sea. I slowly made my last round. Phew!</p>

<p>The result was out instantly, My timing was 1:47min. Not bad for a first timer. I shall focus more on my swim techniques once the marathon is over</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What is haze?<br/>
Burning by products produces tiny smoke particles that travel hundreds and thousnads of miles.<br/>
Thats the reason we see haze.</p>

<p>What can it do to our health.?<br/>
Tiny particles breathe into our lunges are kept and acummulated over the years.</p>

<p>What should we do?<br/>
Stay indoors, shut doors and windows, turn on the airconditioning.<br/>
Air Purifier helps.</p>

<p>At last if you pray, we pray for rain. Rain helps.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>PSI hits a record high of 80. You will see the smoky air, blur skyline, smell the burn. NEA expects the haze to clear by mid October when the moonsoon sets in. Meanwhile I have consider ranning in the gym. I can hardly breathe when I am out in the open. I wonder if they will cancel the open swim on Sunday?</p>

He bought and interesting article of Mia Tan currently in Albania for Miss Globe Int’l pageant.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.miatan.com/?p=72">&#8220;I am not happy here.nope. not one bit.the crew is rude, expects us to listen but never listens to us. made to wake up early and sit and wait in the lobby for hours.<br/>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Face the fact – your blog needs to be regularly updated to maintain its readership! Hence, you must always find fresh topics to write about, and we’re going to discuss how to do just that in this article.</p>

<p>We have discussed how to write attractively, so now we are going to discuss what we are going to write on. The very first option that I think a blogger should write on is a topic that he or she feels passionate and interested in. You’ve chosen to make blogging your career because you want to escape a mundane job – forcing yourself to write about something that you’re not interested in is as torturous as as your mundane job!</p>

<p>The other reason I ask you to write about something you’re passionate about is because your feelings and emotion shows through your writings! If you feel indifferent to a certain subject but still write about it just for the sake of it, your readers will notice it. Remember the advice about writing with a personality? Forcing yourself to write will not establish a welcoming style at all.</p>

<p>Once you have chosen your main theme, start posting to your blog about it and make it a habit to post at least once every day, even if it’s only a comment on the newspaper article you read today. Think of yourself as a gigantic train. It takes a lot of effort to get you moving. First, you might just budge an inch, and later trudge slowly on until you finally reach your full speed. Then, it’ll take a lot of effort to stop you instead!</p>

<p>However, no matter how well you know your topic, your brain is bound to get exhausted over some time, so here are methods to brainstorm for content for your blog.</p>

<p>1) The very best way to brainstorm is to see what other bloggers have to say about stuff happening in your field of discussion. And the very best way to find related blogs is to use http://blogsearch.google.com/ or www.technorati.com. There are other decent search tools too, you just have to look around. From other blogs, you can gather more knowledge on your subject and you can also comment on what others have to say on your own blog!<br/>
2) Once you’ve established contacts with other bloggers in your field, you’ll have quite an unexhaustible “conversation” ongoing, so you’ll not need to actively search for content to write about. However, if you’re still stuck, search for news articles related to your niche in the local newspaper or online through sites like http://news.google.com and http://news.yahoo.com. <br/>
3) You can also have conversations with people with the same interest as you in the particular niche you choose, so you will eventually build up a bank of questions and answers and interesting discussions to write about in your blog. To do this, join forums related to your niche, but don’t join every forum there is out there. Stick with one or two with the biggest number of members or the one which is most focused on your niche. This will also come in handy much later in gaining traffic and generating profits.</p>

<p>Remember to keep up your momentum of posting at least once per day (or more if you have a lot of content to write about) so that the major search engines will know that your blog has fresh content everyday. This will attract the search engines to spider your page on a more frequent basis, hence gaining you extra traffic.</p>

<p>Don’t worry about the paragraph above about generating traffic and search engines, because we’re going to talk about that in more detail later. For now, remember to keep a consistent effort everyday and build up momentum like that of a locomotive!</p>
