  <div class="entry-content"><p>What the differences? Well Basically Make Money From Blogging is simply selling ad sapce on your blog such adsenses, hoping that your users will click on those little ads by the side. While Blogging for money simply uses some SEO techniques to drive your blog ranking up in the google or other serach engine ranking, therefore promoting your product and amking more sales.</p>

<p>I think both strategy should be the same, a blog should target a niche market, nobody is going read about whats going on your life 24/7. If you have a hobby blog specificly about that, create a different blog if need to track other parts of your life, theres no limitation to the no. of blogs you can create, and you can delete them if you dont need them anymore.</p>

<p>Update your blog frequently min every 2 days, search engine spiders loves new content.</p>

<p>Enable RSS feeds and feed it every where&#8230;have some of your friends suscribe to your blog, this increase your rankings.</p>

<p>Comments are good themore the merrier, if you are not getting comments try a more controversial topic.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apparently after some research, people hate ads, so ads has to look not like an ad. The most common ad foramt is the text horizontal bars or the skyscrappers vertical ads. The exciting format that will bring results is the square image ads.</p>

<p>I have also removed all traffic exhange links to remove pop-ups. Other changes include of blog header and descriptions. This will ran for 7 days and we see the responses.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This few days traffic had increase sharply.</p>

<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3581/2300/1600/untitled.1.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3581/2300/320/untitled.1.jpg" alt="" /></a><br/>
Getting links from other websites is not the only way to attract visitors to visit your blog. This time, we are going to explore alternative methods to attract high quality traffic with both free and paid methods.</p>

<p>The first thing you can do to generate traffic is to recycle all the content you have written on your blog. What I really mean is to turn your blog posts into little “manuals” or articles that help people solve their problems or offer valuable information and submit them to article directories. These article directories are like aggregators that collect articles of similar themes together in one place, so they receive thousands and thousands of qualified visitors every day.</p>

<p>When you submit your articles to these directories, you are exposing your name to the thousands of pairs of eyes visiting them for free! On most article directories, you are also permitted to include a “resource box” where you can include your contact details, a simple biography and so on. This is where you can truly leverage the traffic of the said article directories.</p>

<p>Some good article directories to get you started:<br/>
www.eZineArticles.com<br/>
www.ultimatearticledirectory.com<br/>
www.submityourarticle.com</p>

<p>Another excellent way to gain traffic is to join internet forums that is based on your niche. To find these kind of forums, just go to any search engine and enter “ +forum”, without the quotes. You would want the most focused forum with a substantial number of active members, and preferably always bustling with activity. Just check the dates of the threads posted on the forum.</p>

<p>When you join active forums that focus on your field of discussion and post very useful and valuable posts, your peers will start noticing you and paying attention to what you have to say. In most forums, you are also allowed to append a link to your site in the signature line, which is under every post you make on the forums. People will click and visit your blog if they find your posts helpful and informative. This way, your credibility is built even before they land on your blog, so traffic from the forums would be easier to turn into profits if your blog is selling your own products or recommending others’ as an affilliate since they are already convinced you’re an “expert” in the field.</p>

<p>The strategy we’ll discuss is word of mouth. Let’s say you already have a daily visitor count of 100. What if you compiled a small report or gift and posted it on your blog, saying that if a certain visitor can refer three of his/her friends to visit your blog the gift will be his/hers for free? If your small report or gift is lucrative enough, it will generate a small buzz among your blog readers and they will surely refer their friends to this blog that they frequent!</p>

<p>You can also utilize the “blog and ping” technique that everyone’s talking about. Basically, when you update your blog, you can let blog portals such as www.technorati.com know by pinging them. You can ping a lot of portals at once by using the free www.pingomatic.com.</p>

<p>Besides the techniques described here, there are also paid methods like buying links from high-ranking pages or buying banner advertisement space. A thing to keep in mind when buying paid traffic is to always weigh your profits generated from the paid ads. If your profits do no offset the expense, you will end up losing money, so choose wisely.</p>

         | <a href="/blog/2006/09/18/blog-content-brainstorming-2/#disqus_thread">Comments</a>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Face the fact – your blog needs to be regularly updated to maintain its readership! Hence, you must always find fresh topics to write about, and we’re going to discuss how to do just that in this article.</p>

<p>We have discussed how to write attractively, so now we are going to discuss what we are going to write on. The very first option that I think a blogger should write on is a topic that he or she feels passionate and interested in. You’ve chosen to make blogging your career because you want to escape a mundane job – forcing yourself to write about something that you’re not interested in is as torturous as as your mundane job!</p>

<p>The other reason I ask you to write about something you’re passionate about is because your feelings and emotion shows through your writings! If you feel indifferent to a certain subject but still write about it just for the sake of it, your readers will notice it. Remember the advice about writing with a personality? Forcing yourself to write will not establish a welcoming style at all.</p>

<p>Once you have chosen your main theme, start posting to your blog about it and make it a habit to post at least once every day, even if it’s only a comment on the newspaper article you read today. Think of yourself as a gigantic train. It takes a lot of effort to get you moving. First, you might just budge an inch, and later trudge slowly on until you finally reach your full speed. Then, it’ll take a lot of effort to stop you instead!</p>

<p>However, no matter how well you know your topic, your brain is bound to get exhausted over some time, so here are methods to brainstorm for content for your blog.</p>

<p>1) The very best way to brainstorm is to see what other bloggers have to say about stuff happening in your field of discussion. And the very best way to find related blogs is to use <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/">http://blogsearch.google.com/</a> or <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">www.technorati.com</a>. There are other decent search tools too, you just have to look around. From other blogs, you can gather more knowledge on your subject and you can also comment on what others have to say on your own blog!</p>

<p>2) Once you’ve established contacts with other bloggers in your field, you’ll have quite an unexhaustible “conversation” ongoing, so you’ll not need to actively search for content to write about. However, if you’re still stuck, search for news articles related to your niche in the local newspaper or online through sites like <a href="http://news.google.com/">http://news.google.com</a> and <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/">http://news.yahoo.com</a>.</p>

<p>3) You can also have conversations with people with the same interest as you in the particular niche you choose, so you will eventually build up a bank of questions and answers and interesting discussions to write about in your blog. To do this, join forums related to your niche, but don’t join every forum there is out there. Stick with one or two with the biggest number of members or the one which is most focused on your niche. This will also come in handy much later in gaining traffic and generating profits.</p>

<p>Remember to keep up your momentum of posting at least once per day (or more if you have a lot of content to write about) so that the major search engines will know that your blog has fresh content everyday. This will attract the search engines to spider your page on a more frequent basis, hence gaining you extra traffic.</p>

<p>Don’t worry about the paragraph above about generating traffic and search engines, because we’re going to talk about that in more detail later. For now, remember to keep a consistent effort everyday and build up momentum like that of a locomotive!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been working with website since 1997. I build my first owned website <a href="http://wizcodersolution.com">wizcodersolution.com</a> in 2003. It is a staic webpage, I intended it as a promotion for my own software development businesses. it was the year when adsense was first launch, and I sign up then. I have use adsense on my site and sell a few other affiliate softwares.</p>

<p>I started these blog 8 days ago to test google adsense. After checking back my account i have $0.97 from 2003 and 2004. I have not check it for a few years after my webhosting account expired, I never renew, cos no revenue.</p>

<p>I started blogging after some research and I can see that it is a very good way to document what I do to make money online, so that anyone who is seraching for this information can get a litle help from me on where to look for the answers.</p>

<p>I have adjusted the adsense layout too. So lets wait and see.</p>
