  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://a2.vox.com/6a00cd9719d53d4cd500d4142583ea6a47-150wi" alt="" />#32 is different from others because he is a programmer. He is Pierre Omidyar, born on June 21, 1967, a French-Iranian-American entrepreneur and philanthropist/economist. If you have not heard of him you may know him as the founder/chairman of the eBay.</p>

<p>Pierre Omidyar was born in Paris, France. He moved to Maryland with his family when his physician father began his residency at Johns Hopkins University Medical Center. Pierre developed an interest in computing while still at St. Andrew&#8217;s Episcopal School (Maryland) in Bethesda. He taught himself BASIC on a TRS-80. In 1988 he graduated in computer science from Tufts University, and joined Claris, an Apple Computer subsidiary. In 1991, he co-founded Ink Development Corp. with three friends. The company included an Internet shopping segment and was later renamed eShop Inc. Omidyar worked as a software engineer for eShop until the end of 1994, when he became a developer services engineer for General Magic, a mobile communication platform company. In 1996, eShop was sold to Microsoft, but Omidyar remained fascinated by the technical challenges of online commerce.</p>

<p>Omidyar was intrigued by the technical problem of establishing an online venue for direct person-to-person auction of collectible items. Omidyar was 28 when he sat down over a long holiday weekend to write the original computer code for eBay. He created a simple prototype on his personal web page, and launched Auction Web as a sole proprietorship on Labor Day weekend in 1995. Auction Web was later renamed &#8220;eBay&#8221;, after Echo Bay, Omidyar&#8217;s consulting firm, when &#8220;echobay.com&#8221; was unavailable. The service was free at first, but started charging in order to cover Internet service provider costs. Pierre turned eBay into the most successful company of the dotcom era. In September 1998, eBay launched a successful public offering, make Omidyar a billionaire.</p>

<p>From a keynote speech at Tufts University:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;So people often say to me - &#8220;when you built the system, you must have known that making it self-sustainable was the only way eBay could grow to serve 40 million users a day.&#8221; Well&#8230; nope. I made the system self-sustaining for one reason: Back when I launched eBay on Labor Day 1995, eBay wasn&#8217;t my business - it was my hobby. I had to build a system that was self-sustaining&#8230; because I had a real job to go to every morning.</em></p></blockquote>

<p><em>I was working as a software engineer from 10 to 7, and I wanted to have a life on the weekends. So I built a system that could keep working - catching complaints and capturing feedback &#8211; even when Pam and I were out mountain-biking, and the only one home was our cat.&#8221;</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most average blogger will scout around paid-post or link sales networks and pick up scrapes. $5 for a blog post or $3 for a link on your blog. Have you wonder how other blog get $100 dollars or more for a link or paid post? Are you pasting link all over your blog and not making enough for a decent meal at Macdonald&#8217;s?</p>

<p>I got few pointers for you guys if you are looking to improve your pricing.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Set a monthly target on how much you need.<br/>
You need to know how much you need so you know when to stop. Set a reasonable target. If your link is price at$5 don&#8217;t set a target of $1000 link sales. A more appropriates target is $50.</p></li>
<li><p>Use common sense quality control.<br/>
Accept only relevant advertisements to your sites. This makes the links more acceptable to  your users and increase click through which result in returning customer.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not sell more than a month.<br/>
A very common mistake that I see regularly is selling permanent links. Its like having a scare on your face. This will only limit your income potential.</p></li>
<li><p>PR and traffic is important too.<br/>
Link price are pretty much tie to traffic and PR so make sure you spent enough time on both of them. As your traffic and PR increases you can adjust your price accordingly but when they drop do not drop your link price. If you do, you are back to square 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t depend on Advertiser networks to sell your links, ad space or paid post. Email site owners, go to forum, do whatever it takes to make the sales. You are the sales director of your blog, you are in charge of selling, don&#8217;t wait for someone else to do it for you.</p></li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How do you develop a domain? Do you research a niche first, purchase the domain to developed the site or purchase a couple of domain and try to develop them in their niches? Which is the better way? For a internet marketer, niches research is vital, revenue and demand for that particular product or services is crucial to the success of the website. However, for a developer, we look at mass production, cheap domain, fast manufacturing and a quick sale. I personal approach is to scout the market for demand of certain type of websites and develop a bunch of them and sell off cheap. This way I made some quick cash and repeat the process again. Its a lot like real estate development. Sometimes, I develop a site further by adding unique content, getting backlinks, drive traffic and improve its pr. It really depends on the domain I have purchase. I notice a current trend in eBay stores sites, theres a huge increase for demand in eBay affiliate sites. You may want to look into that for your next development.</p>
