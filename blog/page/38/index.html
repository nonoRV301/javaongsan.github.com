  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have accumulated 3 more domains yesterday, but only 1 websites is fully functional. This adds up to my current websites and boasts my inventory count to 11. How do one manage 11 websites (I have 4 more coming) and not to mention the few sites that are running on free hosts?</p>

<p>I have currently 3 active blogs, 3 aggregators, 4 forums, a drupal communtiy site, 1 IM site and 1 myspaces resources site. Out off this 11 the only one that I need to really work on is only this blog which is one of the 3 active blogs. I post onces a day here, a scale down of 4 last year. The other 2 blogs are sports and technology which content can be easily found and updated without much writing. I update them every 2 or 3 days. I still working on the 3 aggregator sites, I don&#8217;t scrape full contents, but I am still unable to make it look like a news sites. These sites require very little of my time, most of the time I am working on the codes. The 4 forums are newly setup, I am promoting them and active anchoring them with interesting topics. I spend less than 30 mins on 4 of them each day. Drupal sites is stuck at design, I am not sure what to do with it yet. Myspaces resources requires no effort from me.</p>

<p>I feel if you found some spared time everyday, don&#8217;t waste it, start a new site. It can be a blog, a simple website or a forum. Who knows what might become of them a year later. Even if you have a job, you can easily manage 3 blogs, and if 1 make a $100 a month 3 will give you a spare cash of $300. Need $10,000 to replace your job, make 1000 websites.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8220;Boy, you got to pay attention to details!&#8221;. I just read the clickbank FAQ, I guess I am the last person on planet earth who missed this. I put all my clickbank affiliate links on iframe. If you don&#8217;t not what I taking about read the 2 clause below.</p>

<p><em><strong>10. Will I get referral credit if I hide hoplinks by making them open into a frame, iframe, layer, applet, image, or other sub-window object?</strong></em></p>

<p><em>No. These are illegal hoplinks. For security reasons, and to ensure proper tracking of your referrals, all hoplinks must be targeted to the top level of a new or existing window.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>11. What happens if I do make illegal hoplinks?</strong></em></p>

<p><em>The short answer is that if you make illegal hoplinks you will lose money.</em></p>

<p><em>Hoplinks targeted to frames or iframes are automatically retargeted to fill the top level of same window, with full affiliate referral credit awarded. Note that this retargeting may have the unintended effect of displacing your entire web site.</em></p>

<p><em>Hoplinks targeted to images or other invisible html objects give you no affilate referral credit at all. In some cases they will also prevent you from receiving affiliate referral credit for legal hoplinks on the same page.</em></p>

<p><em>Accounts that are found to be abusing the hoplink system may be terminated without notice.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This a <a href="http://www.wickedfire.com/affiliate-marketing/21700-recipe-200k-per-year-job.html">post</a> I came across at the wickedfire.com forum by vladi. I am not sure the authenticity of the post but I like what he said in the end &#8220;Use your brains.  Thin outside the box and be creative. I did, and it paid off. &#8221;</p>

<p>I copy the post below.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;OK, you ready to find out how you can earn AT LEAST $200K in 2008?</em></p>

<p><em>Local Search Engine Control</em></p>

<p><em>If you&#8217;re like me, I use Google or have used Google in the past to find restaurants or supply shops in my area. If I am looking for a chinese place because I just moved to the city of OceanSide, then I type in:</em></p>

<p><em>oceanside &#8220;chinese restaurant&#8221;</em></p>

<p><em>What I see is that there are roughly 25,000 listings for that phrase. That&#8217;s under the 40K mark which I set for myself as an upper limit for a niche term to dominate. This becomes important, as you will see in a minute.</em></p>

<p><em>Using whatever methods you want to build pages that will get ranked (usually social network building) you can pretty much get anywhere from 1 to all 10 listings on the first page of Google for that 3 word phrase. There are a variety of ways to do this, but I am not going to get into that, because that is an extensive course in of itself.</em></p>

<p><em>If the search results were over 40K results, then it would be tougher. If there are only 5,000 results, then you&#8217;d probably get all 10 results on the first page. For example:</em></p>

<p><em>rosamond &#8220;chinese restaurant&#8221;</em></p>

<p><em>So I could dominate the city of Rosamond, Ca. for this niche. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a small town out by a race track on the outskirts of L.A. county.</em></p>

<p><em>OK, so where do you go with this? Easy. Here&#8217;s what I did.</em></p>

<p><em>Let&#8217;s say we start with Rosamond. You go in and you capture all 10 spots (or as many as you can) for the key phrase you are going after, and on those pages you promote a fake chinese restaurant. Where the name of the restaurant would go, you call it &#8220;Your-Name-Here Chinese Restaurant.&#8221; There should be links on the page to one or two high PR restuarant guides, as this will give you even more link juice and help you capture as many of the listings on the 1st page of Google. You also link to your website where you describe your services, and you have a phone #.</em></p>

<p><em>Next you put together some kind of marketing campaign for restaurants. You want to hit all the restaurants in that city, whether they be chinese or pizzarias. Doesn&#8217;t matter. You do some direct mail pieces to them. You have to have REALLY good creative in this piece to grab their attention. If you arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a great writer, outsource this to elance, or invest in a really good copyrighting course.</em></p>

<p><em>Tell these owners how they may increase their revenue by 208% (or whatever percentage is factual based on how you spin what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re telling them) by being on the 1st page of Google, blah, blah, blah. Pull up the stats and make it compelling. 80 to 90% of people wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t look past the 1st search results page. Use stuff like that.</em></p>

<p><em>The clincher here is you tell them that you put your money where your mouth is. You wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t charge them a cent unless you can get a page on the first Google results page that mentions their company and is fully controlled by them. This means they can say whatever they want on the page. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need to make sure it still has enough anchor text and keyword text to not drop its listing spot.</em></p>

<p><em>Now you can charge them for this service. In my case, this was a $900 one time charge, or $197 down and then $97 per month for a year. Most take the $900, ONCE they see results.</em></p>

<p><em>But what really sells them is that I tell them to go to Google and do the search term for the ROSAMOND Ã¢â‚¬Å“CHINESE RESTAURANTÃ¢â‚¬ , just to show them that I can do what I say. I tell them that in less then 2 weeks, I have displaced all of the Rosamond, Ca. Chinese restaurants, pushing them off the first page, and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see that I now control those pages. Hell, I could now put text on that page that says:</em></p>

<p><em>Ã¢â‚¬Å“Why would you eat Chinese food when you could have a delicious Pizza at TonyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family Pizzaria. BLAH BLAH BLAHÃ¢â‚¬  Believe me, I have sold Chinese pages to Hamburger joints or sea food places. They are cut throat and want to advertise to anybody looking for a restaurant to eat at. You donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to do this, and you can reserve those Chinese pages just for a Chinese restaurant. You create scarcity, and people will be compelled to buy (thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a whole different educational course.)</em></p>

<p><em>YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be surprised how many businesses see that you have done what you said and want you to do that for their business in their category. You can make it even better by telling them that once that restaurant type is taken (one store only), that its closed, and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s it. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a Chinese Restaurant owner, the last thing you want is for one of your competing Chinese Restaurants to own the majority of the 1st page rankings on Google, especially when your restaurant doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even show up on the first 40 results. And trust me sir, I have sent the same offer to ALL of your competitors. I only need one of you to say YES and then the offer is closed.</em></p>

<p><em>I doubled my income when I changed the formula a bit. For people that wanted to me on the monthly plan, I told them that I wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t charge them anything, but the price was $900 if I could get them on the 1st page. I would then charge an extra $200 for every additional listing I got on the first page. On average, I was able to get 6 to 7 listings per page. The bill would be over $2K and I would tell them that I would make them a deal. If they pay me the $900 upfront for the 1st listing, I would take the remaining $1,200 (6 other listings) and knock it down to just 2 more payments of $200 each, spread out over the next 60 days, or $200 right now (ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s $1,100 total), and 75% of the time I would get my money up front right then and there, because the owners want to save $$$.</em></p>

<p><em>This is important because sometimes a city is too small and just doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get a lot of traffic through Google, so the owner may feel they arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t getting their moneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth if they track their online traffic to their website or phone # or coupons, etc., and they stop paying you. You are in the business of making money, not trying to collect it.</em></p>

<p><em>Another thing is you should never give up the logins and pwÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s to the pages you have created, to the owner, until you are fully paid. I learned this lesson the hard way when I got stiffed and tried to go in and slap the owner and restaurant on the very pages I had created for him, but he had gone in and changed the passwords.</em></p>

<p><em>I could write 10X more than what I have now, but this should already have gotten your brain going.</em></p>

<p><em>Why am I posting this? Surely I will get competition right? EhÃ¢â‚¬ ¦. Maybe, but hereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s my thought on it. First, 99.99% of people will never take action. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a proven fact. I bet 99.9% of the forum users here have ebooks they have downloaded that they havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even read yet. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just the way we are built. We scramble and want to move on to the next thing. For that 0.01% that does take action, good for them. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plenty of room.</em></p>

<p><em>There are roughly 20,000 cities in the USA alone. I could do this in Canada too, remember! And there are at least 10 different major types of restaurants (Chinese, Japanese, Italian, Irish, Sushi, BuffetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, etc.) ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s over 200,000 potential paying accounts, IF only just one of them per city per category type signed up. You could easily sell 2 or 3, making that 400K or 600K paying customers At my rates, the 200K is $180 million dollars, assuming I never upsold them. And thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just one category. I only tap a very small fraction of this amount. And every few years, most restaurants are out of business and you have a whole new pool of customers that have replaced them. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s great!</em></p>

<p><em>What if instead of restaurants I want to go after car stereo shops, or fitness centers, or dentists, etc. There are hundreds, maybe thousands of niches you can get into.</em></p>

<p><em>Instead of brick and morter shops, you could go after online websites and do this globally. Now you have access to tens of millions of businesses!</em></p>

<p><em>IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve done it part time, outsourcing almost all of it, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s generated well into the 6 figures per year. 2008 will probably double for me. This is just one of the many things I do, and one of the smaller ones.</em></p>

<p><em>Please donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t PM me about this, as I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have time for individual chatting or tutoring. If you have questions or comments, post them here for everybody to share.</em></p>

<p><em>I would love to hear from those of you who actually do this. Post your results here in this thread.</em></p>

<p><em>And before you post a question, really THINK about what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re about to ask. 90% of what I see asked in this forum is really annoying because the answers are readily available if you only did a quick Google search. Use your brains. Thin outside the box and be creative. I did, and it paid off.&#8221;</em></p>
