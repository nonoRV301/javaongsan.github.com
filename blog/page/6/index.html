  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are a few articles on home office in the newspaper. Most of it revolve around creating a structure and being discipline. It felt like these people are creating a environment similar to a job except that you are at home. The main reason we set up home office are because we want freedom, work when we please, and we feel like it. Creating a structure? If i need structure and discipline I would get a job or get a real office.</p>

<p><strong>Furnishing your home office.</strong><br/>
If you are starting out, I would minimize and improvise on furniture. If you Spend $3000 on new equipment, it will eat into your profit, advertisings or marketing cost. I would get better equipment when my business picks up, and add more on the way. That way I spending what I can afford.</p>

<p><strong>Meeting client</strong><br/>
It would be easier to meet the client at their place, rather than have it the other way around. at the same time allows you to get some fresh air.</p>

<p>What matter most is &#8221;<strong>Its your rules!</strong>&#8221;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I get a lot of people asking me how did I survive 6 month without a job. First of all I got to make it clear, I did not have a regular job but I have several  source of income. I have a internet business, a few traditional business and I taught martial arts on a 1 on 1 basis. Although the combine income is less than a thousand but it was more than enough for my survive. There are several ways to cut back on daily expenses as well. I made a list here.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Track your expense down to the tiniest detail. Record what you paid for allows for comparison later, which helps to find the cheapest source.</p></li>
<li><p>Eat cheaply, instant noodles, fired rice, bread, potatoes etc all those that are filling and comes n large portions.</p></li>
<li><p>Skip the public transport, run, walk or bike instead.</p></li>
<li><p>Always allow your friends to pay for your food, and accept their second hand stuffs.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>These are just tip of the ice berg, I wonder if anyone have any interesting ideas to share?</p>

<p>There are several projects I have in mind after recently been to some local PHP meetups. With my schedule revolving   around my work, I am blogging less. There so much to write and so little time. I need some time to sit down and organize to document some of things that I have done here. So stayed tune.</p>

<time datetime="2008-05-19T19:30:00+08:00" pubdate data-updated="true">May 19<span>th</span>, 2008</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Bi-lateral breathing requires the swimmer to change breathing sides after each stroke cycle. The cycle could be 3 strokes, 5 strokes or so on. This skill will help eliminate neck and shoulder fatigue and promotes better balance and body alignment. Bilateral breathing is also an essential navigational skill in open water.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.trifuel.com/training/swim/swimming-bi-lateral-breathing">trifuel.com</a>   has a very good article on <a href="http://www.trifuel.com/training/swim/swimming-bi-lateral-breathing">Bi-Lateral Breathing</a>.</p>

<p>Why bi-lateral breathe?<br/>
Bi-lateral breathing helps swimmers ‘balance out their stroke and teaches them to rotate their hips on both sides of their stroke.</p>

<p>One of the most common faults in free style swimming is to under roll on the non-breathing side. It’s easy to roll on the side you breathe too, but not so easy to roll on the side you don’t breathe to. This under-rolling can lead to less power as you don’t finish your swim stroke as strongly as you could if you were on your breathing side. Bi-lateral breathing helps you smooth out the stroke, keeps you balanced, and in some cases lets you swim in a straighter line.</p>

<p>One of the most important benefits of bi-lateral breathing is that is helps you to limit the amount of stress that is put on your shoulders due to the constant strain of breathing to only one side. Another benefit of bi-lateral breathing is that you can watch your recovery (is your elbow high and are you fingertips dragging across the water?) and you can watch you hand entry (does your hand enter in the order of fingertips, wrist, elbow, and at a 45 degree angle?). Being aware of what happens on both sides of your stroke will allow you to see what is happening and let you make corrections as you progress. One last advantage of BLB is that in a race you can see what is going on both sides of you, not just one. If the waves are breaking over your right side, you can switch to breathing to your left or vice versa. Also, if you have a swimmer you want to keep up with, you can always see where he/she is if you can BLB.</p>

<p>How do I improve my bi-lateral breathing?<br/>
The best advice I can give someone who is not proficient at BLB is to ‘just do it’ – start with breathing on your weaker side (the one you aren’t used to breathing on) – when I coached swimming there was always one set per day that had to be swum on the weak side (WS) – it was tough and most swimmers hated it, but it made their BLB swimming that much better. Back then my instructions were to jump in and swim 500 yards on your WS. Now that I am a more compassionate coach I would recommend swimming a 25 BLB, then 50 normal, then 25 BLB again. I like to see swimmers progress from 25 yards all the way up to 200 in a few sessions. Once you get to 200 yards then you can swim sets – like 5x200 on 10 second rest BLB. But wait! You are saying only 10 seconds rest after a 200 yard swim? Yes, that would be correct. The key is to swim the BLB sets easy enough that you not sucking wind (think ‘long and strong’ on your swim stroke). If you can do this then soon enough you will be swimming 1,000 yards or more pretty easily.</p>

<p>BLB swim sets:</p>

<ul>
<li>Warm-up: 200 yards alternating BLB every 3rd length.</li>
<li>Main set: 4x100 on 10” rest, with 1st and 4th length being BLB</li>
<li>4x100 on 10” rest with middle 50 being weak side breathing</li>
<li>3x200 on 15” rest. Swim 200 as follows: 50 blb, 50 ws, 50 blb, 50 ws</li>
<li>Cool down – same as warm up</li>
</ul>


<p>More Advanced (simple but effective):</p>

<ul>
<li>Warm-up: 200 yards alternating BLB every 3rd length.</li>
<li>Then 45 minutes of 200s blb on 10” rest. These are easy enough to not need much rest, but hard enough to make you focus on the blb. Slow the stroke down and focus on all aspects of your breathing, hand entry, pull, finish, recovery.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you want to swim fast correctly, you need to learn to swim slowly correctly first!</p>
