  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am working half day so decide to ride to work. Th distance is about 13km. The traffic was low but I experience some difficulty climbing the incline parts, it was only a slight incline but I left weak and out of breathe. The bike is great way to test out fitness, and looks like I am really out of shape. I took about 30mins on the way there and 45mins back. I should start riding more to regain my fitness.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Are you thinking of starting another blog? What are the some of the points to take note of? I have learned some important things about operating multiple blogs and websites since I started online.</p>

<p>Do you have time to start another blog?<br/>
How much spare time do you have? Many people have full-time jobs and work more than your average 40 hour per week. They have a family and commitments. Take some time to evaluate your life right now. Come up with a schedule of your life in blocks of 2 hours. block out your working hours and traveling time to work. Fill out your family time, meal time, entertainment time, workout time, blogging time and whatever is that you do. At the end of this exercise, you have clear idea of where all your time goes to. Find the block of time which are non productive like watching TV, reading newspaper or anything thats does not contribute to growing your income. All you need are 1 block of 2 hours a day.</p>

<p>Define blogging frequency and posting time before hand. When you start a second blog it might seem quick and easy to maintain, but it will only become more involved and time consuming over time. A discipline approach will help you go further. You may reevaluate your schedule every quarter and adjust your time slot accordingly.</p>

<p>Before you start a new blog, take some time and do a self evaluation. Only start enough blog that you have time for. The last thing you want is to start too many blogs and have to give up some of them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For those who have been reading this blog, you notice this blog went completely offline for more than a month. While a few months back, my server was hacked and I had to shutdown all my websites. After failed attempts by my hosting company to fix my servers. I decide to look for another hosting company. This time I decided not to put all my eggs in one basket and split up my sites so when one site is attacked another is still up. This process of looking and researching took me quite a while. I have look at control panels, bandwidth, storage, rams and study and refreshed a lot of my hardware and networking  knowledge.  Basically cpanel requires 256mb ram just to ran it, that means you have to purchase a bigger ram than 256mb and don&#8217;t count on bustable ram. Directadmin another control panel requires 128mb, lxadmin is the lightest is able to ran on less. I am currently using cpanel (because it very user friendly) and lxadmin (because its a cheaper version. I should have taken the advice of looking for a reliable host, but this type of reviews are really rare, I guess most webmaster either had the knowledge or had someone to do it for them. I would strongly recommend getting someone to help you out on your hosting if you are not familiar.</p>

<p>Having my sites down means an income drop as well. Still I manage to  pull in $100-$200 for March and April. Its quite impressive with most of my adsense, paid post site not working. That&#8217;s the beauty of diversity, don&#8217;t just make income form your blog, get another source of income and another and another&#8230; In this period of time, I have really have time to look at and review what I was doing (and ya I wireless modem died on me and took me a while to get a replacement so I really had a lot of time.). I was building too many sits that will not withstand the test of time. I need to build a foundation of sites that could build me my Empire. I have also come to realize that I do not have a whole lot of friends who I can turn to for advice on business or technical stuffs so at this point I sending out invitations to anyone who is interested to be my advisers or need advise or like to make friends to be on my gtalk, my choice of IM. You can sent me your gmail address using <a href="http://www.contactify.com/0b095">this link</a> and I add you. This is good for exchanging of business ideas or for technical advices. So we will be back for more, I have tons of work waiting for me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thomas from <a href="http://www.superaffiliatemindset.com/guy-makes-42-million-in-5-hours-with-cellphone/">Super Affiliate Mindset</a> post this great story about LEVERAGE.</p>

<p>John, (my friend) has niched himself as a private physical therapist that caters to a wealthy client base - CEO&#8217;s, sport figures, etc. One day he went golfing with one of his clients, a VERY successful entrepreneur, so he could evaluate his clients swing and see if he could pinpoint the source of the back pain he was experiencing. (Now mind you, this guy&#8217;s got serious cash. He even has a private gas station on his property.)</p>

<p>While they were playing, his client received a phone call from one of his business partners. They chatted for about 10 minutes or so, then continued to golf. During the rest of the day, the guy continued to make a few more calls back and forth until they finished the course.</p>

<p>Afterwards, they hit the bar to have a few drinks at the club. John asked his client, â€œwhat were all those phone calls about?â€ The guy said, â€œMy business partner found a golf course for sale and was asking if I wanted to get in on it with him. I made a few calls to some other people I know and sold it for $4.2 million more.â€</p>

<p>John said â€œWow, thats amazing. How do you come across a deal like this and sell it so quickly?â€</p>

<p>His client responded, â€œI have spent 35 years building my little black book of contacts that I carry with me at all times. It contains about a hundred people out of the thousands I have met. Each one is a hand-picked, valuable resource and personal friend. It&#8217;s my leverage.â€</p>

He is Pierre Omidyar, born on June 21, 1967, a French-Iranian-American entrepreneur and philanthropist/economist. If you have not heard of him you may know him as the founder/chairman of the eBay.</p>

<p>Pierre Omidyar was born in Paris, France. He moved to Maryland with his family when his physician father began his residency at Johns Hopkins University Medical Center. Pierre developed an interest in computing while still at St. Andrew&#8217;s Episcopal School (Maryland) in Bethesda. He taught himself BASIC on a TRS-80. In 1988 he graduated in computer science from Tufts University, and joined Claris, an Apple Computer subsidiary. In 1991, he co-founded Ink Development Corp. with three friends. The company included an Internet shopping segment and was later renamed eShop Inc. Omidyar worked as a software engineer for eShop until the end of 1994, when he became a developer services engineer for General Magic, a mobile communication platform company. In 1996, eShop was sold to Microsoft, but Omidyar remained fascinated by the technical challenges of online commerce.</p>

<p>Omidyar was intrigued by the technical problem of establishing an online venue for direct person-to-person auction of collectible items. Omidyar was 28 when he sat down over a long holiday weekend to write the original computer code for eBay. He created a simple prototype on his personal web page, and launched Auction Web as a sole proprietorship on Labor Day weekend in 1995. Auction Web was later renamed &#8220;eBay&#8221;, after Echo Bay, Omidyar&#8217;s consulting firm, when &#8220;echobay.com&#8221; was unavailable. The service was free at first, but started charging in order to cover Internet service provider costs. Pierre turned eBay into the most successful company of the dotcom era. In September 1998, eBay launched a successful public offering, make Omidyar a billionaire.</p>

<p>From a keynote speech at Tufts University:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;So people often say to me - &#8220;when you built the system, you must have known that making it self-sustainable was the only way eBay could grow to serve 40 million users a day.&#8221; Well&#8230; nope. I made the system self-sustaining for one reason: Back when I launched eBay on Labor Day 1995, eBay wasn&#8217;t my business - it was my hobby. I had to build a system that was self-sustaining&#8230; because I had a real job to go to every morning.</em></p></blockquote>

<p><em>I was working as a software engineer from 10 to 7, and I wanted to have a life on the weekends. So I built a system that could keep working - catching complaints and capturing feedback &#8211; even when Pam and I were out mountain-biking, and the only one home was our cat.&#8221;</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most average blogger will scout around paid-post or link sales networks and pick up scrapes. $5 for a blog post or $3 for a link on your blog. Have you wonder how other blog get $100 dollars or more for a link or paid post? Are you pasting link all over your blog and not making enough for a decent meal at Macdonald&#8217;s?</p>

<p>I got few pointers for you guys if you are looking to improve your pricing.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Set a monthly target on how much you need.<br/>
You need to know how much you need so you know when to stop. Set a reasonable target. If your link is price at$5 don&#8217;t set a target of $1000 link sales. A more appropriates target is $50.</p></li>
<li><p>Use common sense quality control.<br/>
Accept only relevant advertisements to your sites. This makes the links more acceptable to  your users and increase click through which result in returning customer.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not sell more than a month.<br/>
A very common mistake that I see regularly is selling permanent links. Its like having a scare on your face. This will only limit your income potential.</p></li>
<li><p>PR and traffic is important too.<br/>
Link price are pretty much tie to traffic and PR so make sure you spent enough time on both of them. As your traffic and PR increases you can adjust your price accordingly but when they drop do not drop your link price. If you do, you are back to square 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t depend on Advertiser networks to sell your links, ad space or paid post. Email site owners, go to forum, do whatever it takes to make the sales. You are the sales director of your blog, you are in charge of selling, don&#8217;t wait for someone else to do it for you.</p></li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How do you develop a domain? Do you research a niche first, purchase the domain to developed the site or purchase a couple of domain and try to develop them in their niches? Which is the better way? For a internet marketer, niches research is vital, revenue and demand for that particular product or services is crucial to the success of the website. However, for a developer, we look at mass production, cheap domain, fast manufacturing and a quick sale. I personal approach is to scout the market for demand of certain type of websites and develop a bunch of them and sell off cheap. This way I made some quick cash and repeat the process again. Its a lot like real estate development. Sometimes, I develop a site further by adding unique content, getting backlinks, drive traffic and improve its pr. It really depends on the domain I have purchase. I notice a current trend in eBay stores sites, theres a huge increase for demand in eBay affiliate sites. You may want to look into that for your next development.</p>
