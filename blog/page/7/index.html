  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wikipedia describe entrepreneur as An entrepreneur is a person who operates a new enterprise or venture and assumes some accountability for the inherent risks. If you have line up all the successful entrepreneur in the world and tried to profile them, you find that they all different. From the size, looks, to the way they think and operate. There are no fixed rule to become an entrepreneur, but at some point you be required to take risks or perform and work in a way that most peers will not. If you go back to all the successful entrepreneurs and ask them for the key to their success, you probably get as many as the number of people you asked. How do become successful? We do it by failing more than others and we get up each time. Technical skills like marketing, writing business plan, managing can be learn but attitude and commitment are forged through countless hardship, visualization, developing passion and undying attitude. What the most important thing you can do to be a successful entrepreneur is simply &#8220;Don&#8217;t Quit&#8221;</p>

It must been ease when the support staffs are rolling the backups. Well looks like I need to put some really good contents back.

<p>The contest is simply, just <a href="mailto:admin@wizcodersolution.com">email</a> your post to me and the highest hit post wins.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I define entrepreneur as someone who have control over their own future. Every entrepreneur is different. Each has their own set of strengths, weaknesses, talents and abilities. However, entrepreneurs who have stood the test of time and have made a difference do share common characteristics. What words do you associate with an entrepreneur? Passion, vision, leadership, commitment?</p>

<p>What are the three key characteristics of an entrepreneur?
1.<strong>Vision</strong>
Entrepreneurs provides a sense of direction by being the light at the end of the tunnel. Their the guiding stars when everyone else are lost. Vision helps the entrepreneur to define their goals. Vision is used to clearly communicated the goals to the stakeholders and must motivate them. To be successful the entrepreneur first needs to understand why these stakeholders will find the vision appealing and benefits them. Once the vision is in place the entrepreneur can start work on the business plan.</p>

<p>2.<strong>High risk-taker</strong>
Entrepreneurs are constantly moving and exploring uncharted waters, redefining, improving certain traits that often treated as risk by conventional business owner. Entrepreneurs understands the need for breakthroughs and in order to break new grounds, calculated risk must be taken. More often the higher the risk, the higher the rewards or failure. Entrepreneurs allow themselves to fail and learn form past experiences.</p>

<p>3.<strong>Hard work</strong>
A recent study show that the average number of hours put in from an entrepreneurs amount to 60 hours per week or more. However, I believe that&#8217;s the minimum. An entrepreneurs is constantly working, their are loaded with issues and every minute is spent trying to solve a problem.</p>

<p>Entrepreneurs are individuals but we must not mistaken that entrepreneursÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ individual knowledge and skill is irrelevant to the success of a new venture. Entrepreneurs are just people who work hard to gain control over their own futures.</p>

<p>Do you have the characteristics of an entrepreneur? Which characteristics do you have and how ell do you made use of it? Sent us your stories.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The actual question is What are your criteria for subscribing to a particular RSS feed? Feed count, popularity or simply because you like it? What ever your reason, you shouldn&#8217;t have a criteria. In fact, my suggestion is to subscribe to any blog you came across. like anyone else I don&#8217;t like to help a blog increased their feed count or readership by subscribing to them, especially when there are only 1 digit. I do not subscribe to any blog who I am not found of, or if I think they are boring, or for whatever reason. Since reading a post y John Chow about his idea of tracking a numerous blogs for ideas, I started to wonder. Could I be missing out on some valuable informations by refusing to subscribe to a blog? I think the answer is obvious. Now that I amÃ‚   writingÃ‚   more blog, I need more informations,Ã‚   someÃ‚   in specific niche, I found that its really useful to read more blogs. Not only does it generate new ideas for content, some of them have good writing styles which I can follow. I may also be tracking blogs that are starting out and testing certain techniques on blogging or affiliate marketing. There a lot of things that I learn through other people&#8217;s experiences.</p>

<p>Many will argue the time I wasted tracking so many feeds, well I not going for PHD here so I don&#8217;t study every single content in details, I simple do a quick scan of all the titles and pick out a few that I will go through. You may also used different readers, or create different foldersÃ‚   to separate the feeds. A golden rule that I live by now &#8220;Only Subscribe, Do Not Unsubscribe!&#8221;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s the start of a new month and that means it&#8217;s time for do our income report. I been making money from blogging and other online marketing methods since May 2007. I always treat it as a game, trying to break new high score every month. I have made from varies source (see my <a href="http://javaongsan.github.com/2007/11/10/money-maker-2/">money makers</a>) but I did not manage to keep a steady source which look more like a hit and run.</p>

<p>During the new year I made decision to break the $300 mark and achieve $500 per month, and double it each month after. Keep in mind I have accumulated 14 sites now. So how did I do for January.</p>

<p><strong>Total Blog Income For January 2008: $</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://javaongsan.reseller.hop.clickbank.net/">clickbank</a></p>

<p>$17.98</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sponsoredreviews.com/?aid=2496">sponsoredreviews.com</a></p>

<p>31</p>

<p>Adsense</p>

<p>10</p>

<p><strong>Total </strong></p>

<p><strong>$110.48</strong></p>

<p>Despite making an effort to increase my earning from blogs and Adsense sites, I neglected the more profitable ebook sale sites. Although Adsense earning decline, I been getting pretty good ads on my blogs. One of my recurring problem is that my VPS tend to crash from time to time. I have figure out the problem yet.</p>

<p>Advertising expenses for the month was $0.2 and VPS Hosting $44.5. I also purchased $144.85 worth of domains. So this is not a profitable month. For next month, I will double the earning of this month.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are lots of debate on the number of blog one should have. Most successful bloggers are likely to write only one blog and it seems like you only need one blog to be profitable. What happens when your blog did not take off? Maybe there are no readers, not enough traffic, or simply a bad niche? I do believe that if you work hard on one blog alone, you eventually get there, but what about when you have not make it yet. Your blog have too little traffic or readers to sell advertisement and your Adsense earning is only a few cents for entire month.</p>

<p>When I started, I started 5 blogs and only kept 2. Overtime I have started new blogs, keep some going and shutdown some. I was working on a full-time job back then, I still found time to work each blog daily. There are many benefits of starting multiple blogs. You have a sharper learning curve, you save time by experimenting different things on different blogs. After a period of time, you will shutdown the less preforming ones and work on the better performing ones. You choose to let this discarded blog float, where you might find some use for them in the future or use it to link to some of your websites, you might even be able to sell links or advertising spaces on them.</p>

<p>While most of my blog were started with free host, I have found that time and time again that if you host your own blog, you get better traffic fast. I have one blog lunch that will gain organic traffic the next day. Of course there a lot more SEO tactics involved but then again you can&#8217;t use them on free hosts like blogger.</p>

<p>I doÃ‚   recommend you start as many blogs as you can, even 1 a day is not too much. Start them on a good domain name. Pack them with contents,Ã‚   try to write as many post as possible till you run dry of content before your lunch. Always have a sitemap and submit them to the search engines. Always have some kind of tracking code like Google analytics where you are to track keywords and popular post. Once you get a couple of blog, you can make money by doing paid posts, selling links or ad space, or you can sell the entire blog.</p>

<p>Just in case you are wondering I run 7 blogs now. Its definitely more profitable than when I am running one.</p>
