  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://a2.vox.com/6a00cd9719d53d4cd500d4142583ea6a47-150wi" alt="" />#32 is different from others because he is a programmer. He is Pierre Omidyar, born on June 21, 1967, a French-Iranian-American entrepreneur and philanthropist/economist. If you have not heard of him you may know him as the founder/chairman of the eBay.</p>

<p>Pierre Omidyar was born in Paris, France. He moved to Maryland with his family when his physician father began his residency at Johns Hopkins University Medical Center. Pierre developed an interest in computing while still at St. Andrew&#8217;s Episcopal School (Maryland) in Bethesda. He taught himself BASIC on a TRS-80. In 1988 he graduated in computer science from Tufts University, and joined Claris, an Apple Computer subsidiary. In 1991, he co-founded Ink Development Corp. with three friends. The company included an Internet shopping segment and was later renamed eShop Inc. Omidyar worked as a software engineer for eShop until the end of 1994, when he became a developer services engineer for General Magic, a mobile communication platform company. In 1996, eShop was sold to Microsoft, but Omidyar remained fascinated by the technical challenges of online commerce.</p>

<p>Omidyar was intrigued by the technical problem of establishing an online venue for direct person-to-person auction of collectible items. Omidyar was 28 when he sat down over a long holiday weekend to write the original computer code for eBay. He created a simple prototype on his personal web page, and launched Auction Web as a sole proprietorship on Labor Day weekend in 1995. Auction Web was later renamed &#8220;eBay&#8221;, after Echo Bay, Omidyar&#8217;s consulting firm, when &#8220;echobay.com&#8221; was unavailable. The service was free at first, but started charging in order to cover Internet service provider costs. Pierre turned eBay into the most successful company of the dotcom era. In September 1998, eBay launched a successful public offering, make Omidyar a billionaire.</p>

<p>From a keynote speech at Tufts University:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;So people often say to me - &#8220;when you built the system, you must have known that making it self-sustainable was the only way eBay could grow to serve 40 million users a day.&#8221; Well&#8230; nope. I made the system self-sustaining for one reason: Back when I launched eBay on Labor Day 1995, eBay wasn&#8217;t my business - it was my hobby. I had to build a system that was self-sustaining&#8230; because I had a real job to go to every morning.</em></p></blockquote>

<p><em>I was working as a software engineer from 10 to 7, and I wanted to have a life on the weekends. So I built a system that could keep working - catching complaints and capturing feedback &#8211; even when Pam and I were out mountain-biking, and the only one home was our cat.&#8221;</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most average blogger will scout around paid-post or link sales networks and pick up scrapes. $5 for a blog post or $3 for a link on your blog. Have you wonder how other blog get $100 dollars or more for a link or paid post? Are you pasting link all over your blog and not making enough for a decent meal at Macdonald&#8217;s?</p>

<p>I got few pointers for you guys if you are looking to improve your pricing.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Set a monthly target on how much you need.<br/>
You need to know how much you need so you know when to stop. Set a reasonable target. If your link is price at$5 don&#8217;t set a target of $1000 link sales. A more appropriates target is $50.</p></li>
<li><p>Use common sense quality control.<br/>
Accept only relevant advertisements to your sites. This makes the links more acceptable to  your users and increase click through which result in returning customer.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not sell more than a month.<br/>
A very common mistake that I see regularly is selling permanent links. Its like having a scare on your face. This will only limit your income potential.</p></li>
<li><p>PR and traffic is important too.<br/>
Link price are pretty much tie to traffic and PR so make sure you spent enough time on both of them. As your traffic and PR increases you can adjust your price accordingly but when they drop do not drop your link price. If you do, you are back to square 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t depend on Advertiser networks to sell your links, ad space or paid post. Email site owners, go to forum, do whatever it takes to make the sales. You are the sales director of your blog, you are in charge of selling, don&#8217;t wait for someone else to do it for you.</p></li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How do you develop a domain? Do you research a niche first, purchase the domain to developed the site or purchase a couple of domain and try to develop them in their niches? Which is the better way? For a internet marketer, niches research is vital, revenue and demand for that particular product or services is crucial to the success of the website. However, for a developer, we look at mass production, cheap domain, fast manufacturing and a quick sale. I personal approach is to scout the market for demand of certain type of websites and develop a bunch of them and sell off cheap. This way I made some quick cash and repeat the process again. Its a lot like real estate development. Sometimes, I develop a site further by adding unique content, getting backlinks, drive traffic and improve its pr. It really depends on the domain I have purchase. I notice a current trend in eBay stores sites, theres a huge increase for demand in eBay affiliate sites. You may want to look into that for your next development.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Contrary to popular believe, you can&#8217;t make lots of money blogging. If you believe that writing a blog will eventually make you a six figure income and quick your job, this is going to hurt. I know you list all the six figure income bloggers and all your endless example to prove me   wrong. If you are one such blogger, I grantee your income is as low as your daily bus fare.</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t make money blogging, you make money marketing your blog. Make Sense? Income from blogs comes from ad placement. To sell and ad you need to market your blog. No advertiser will know that you have a blog and that you are selling ad space. To promote your blog, you need to do it at forums, other blog, social networking sites and build up your brand. Then you need traffic and readers to boast your revenue, you can&#8217;t get this by blogging. You get this done by doing  whole lot of other things.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After a few month of blogging, you find that you are stuck and you need to blog constantly to keep your traffic, revenue and readers. What happens when you need to spent time with your family during weekends, work overtime on a new project or go away on a trip? The best way would be to write you post in advance, stock them up for rainy days.</p>

<p>I used different method to generate posts. When you finish a post, take sometime to write another post on the same topic retaining   most of the content, giving it a different twist. These posts can be recall in the future when you need something urgently. Write a series of post about 5 to 7 surrounding a particular topic. This post can be used on occasions when you are away for a few days.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I read a book once titled &#8220;Get Real and Get rich&#8221; or something like that, I don&#8217;t remember the exact title. In the book the author relive that his secret to getting rich was by starting a part-time business, bidding on paint jobs on newly developed apartments. By bidding a $100 dollars lower than the lowest bid, he managed to saved enough money to start investing and finally achieved financial freedom. This is the only part of the story I remember, as I was trying to figure out how I can do the same but do it online. The first thought would be to make used of my programming skills and start offering my services, but if you to compare both. A website is dynamic, every project is different, requirement changes, its not like painting a house one after the other. What I need is to find something, that I could duplicate. The best approach is to develop a series of websites and sell them. Still, it requires hard work and a specialize skill.</p>

<p>Flipping website, is a concept which you buy a websites and sell it off at a higher value. To sell a website, we need to know what the buyers are looking for. Most buyers are looking for complete websites such as blog, forum, or community sites with revenue and traffic. The higher the traffic and revenue the higher the value. It seems like a simple plan but who in the right mind would sell off a profitable site for capital gain? Webmaster who have too many websites and unable to manage, owners who wants out, developer who developed sites for the purpose of capital gains. Not only it is rarely to find a good site but to out bid your competitors is tough. The next available option will be to buy turnkey websites which are sites that are newly developed. This site normally comes cheap generally below $50, have no revenue and no traffic. With a little effort in marketing and promotion, you can get this site profitable and sell them using the rule of 12/24 months revenue. If you make $50 with that site you can sell it for $600 or more. If you are familiar with programming, you can look out for uncompleted sites, finish it up and put it in the market for a quick but small profit.</p>

<p>Whatever you approach is, there are several things to note when buying a websites. Ask for verification of earnings and traffic, don&#8217;t just take the sellers word. Take a look at the site, make sure there are activities. Check the domain registry, what the cost involved in transferring a domain and what is the time frame. Sometimes transferring domain between different providers takes longer, while some providers are not supported. Newly register or changed domain can only be transfer after 60 days. The type hosting required needs to be clarified, some sites may have specific requirements that requires a special type of host. Always make it a point to have the seller ready to assist you in the upload if any things goes wrong.</p>

<p>While flipping websites may not make you millions but its a additional stream of revenue, but it adds to your arsenal of money making tools.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s the start of a new month and that means it&#8217;s time for do our income report. I been making money from blogging and other online marketing methods since May 2007. I always treat it as a game, trying to break new high score every month. I have made from varies source (see my <a href="http://wizcodersolution.com/2007/11/10/money-maker-2/">money makers</a>) but I did not manage to keep a steady source which look more like a hit and run.</p>

<p>During the new year I made decision to break the $300 mark and achieve $500 per month, and double it each month after. Keep in mind I have accumulated 14 sites now. So how did I do for Feburary.</p>

<p><strong>Total Income For Feburary 2008: $</strong><br/>
Adsense: $94.24<br/>
Ebook: $135<br/>
PaidPost: $38<br/>
Private ads: $90<br/>
Site Sales: $180<br/>
<strong>Total:537.24</strong></p>

<p>I have increased Adsense earning sharply because of the number of sites I have. I also make 2 new revenue stream from selling some sites I make and from private ads sales, this prove to be the most lucrative income. Using PPC I have increase Ebook sales but not as much as I want to. Paid Post is disapointing and tough work. I will only do paid post for offers that is $50 and above.</p>

<p>I was away most of the time in Feburary, It has become very difficult to blog and update my sites daily. One of my recurring problem is that my VPS tend to crash from time to time. I have reinstall my server and my site was down for a few days. My plan currently is to sell all my remaining <a href="http://wizcodersolution.com/2008/02/12/vps-down-for-24-hours/">11 sites</a>. I will sell this blog as well. There will be no more income report as I have not been able to generate any revenue form this blog. I have taken off all my ads.</p>

<p>Advertising expenses for the month was $30 and VPS Hosting $44.50. For next month, I will double the earning of this month.</p>
