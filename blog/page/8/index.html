      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Quick and dirty way to make $100 a day.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use <a href="http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-2613438-10405191">Go Daddy Bulk Domain Registration</a><img src="http://www.ftjcfx.com/image-2613438-10405191" alt="" /> and grad 100 domains.</p></li>
<li><p>Get a host, VPS prefer, from <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-2613438-10378494">GoDaddy.com Hosting Plans</a><img src="http://www.ftjcfx.com/image-2613438-10378494" alt="" /> or somewhere better.</p></li>
<li><p>Download install wordpress with plugging like adsense-deluxe.php, google-sitemap-generator, and feedwordpress on all 100 domains.</p></li>
<li><p>Setup rss feeds with feedwordpress. I prefer to use technorati search.</p></li>
<li><p>Slap on Adsense.</p></li>
<li><p>Submit sitemap to Google webmaster central.</p></li>
<li><p>Go Live</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Almost immediate, you start getting organic traffic from search engines. Adsense earning will start going up eventually will float around $1 after a week for each domain. For 100 domains, you make $100 a day. Its get more stable after a month and die off after that. Before that you could get 1 or 2 months of good organic traffic with almost 1000 uniques a day on 1 technorati tags.</p>

<p>If we work it out.</p>

<p>$1 x 100 (domains) x 60 (2 months) = $6000 - $700 (domain cost) - $50 (hosting) = $5 250.</p>

<p>Of course there several , downside to this techniques beside ethical issues. The original content owner will be unhappy and threaten you to remove their content. You also have a bandwidth issue, if you hosting bandwidth is too small, you site crash frequently. You also have redesign these 100 domains after they loose steam. Sometimes a website can die prematurely after a few days if you are not well verse in SEO.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every year, on Valentines Day I send flowers to my wife&#8217;s office, that a big for deal for the ladies. If you haven&#8217;t notice, pay attention when a bouquet arrives and how every single one of them get excited about it.  As a guy ordering and getting flowers is a nightmare, not to mention the treatment from those unfriendly shop assistances. I would normally place my order a week before on a website <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=108912&amp;u=193030&amp;m=7726&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=">www.Flora2000.com!</a>. I have using the website for a few years and they have always delivered. If you wondering what to get your ladies, I recommend sending a dozen roses, its the best gift I know of.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/01/21/wordpress-boosts-free-storage-to-3gb-leaves-blogger-typepad-in-the-dust/">techcrunch.com</a> posted &#8220;In a move that will no doubt put pressure on competing blog platforms TypePad (from Six Apart) and Blogger (from Google), WordPress (from Automattic) is boosting free storage for all the blogs it hosts from 50 MB to 3 GB. Founder Matt Mullenweg notes that is three times as much free space as Blogger currently offers, and that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d have to pay $300 a year to get as much storage on TypePad. The increase is made possible because WordPress uses AmazonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s S3 storage service, and it is passing on increased efficiencies on to its customers.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have used all three platform, I discarded TypePad at first try, it was not the experience I am looking for. I prefer blogspot over wordpress.com because you are allow to use scripts on blogspot. For wordpress.com supporters, the main problem would be storage space. They need 3rd partly source to host images and video when their blog gets too big. We be expecting blogger and Typepad to response to this soon, and when that happens more storage for everyone.</p>

<p>How many of you are still on wordpress.com, blogger.com$, or Typepad.com?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have accumulated 3 more domains yesterday, but only 1 websites is fully functional. This adds up to my current websites and boasts my inventory count to 11. How do one manage 11 websites (I have 4 more coming) and not to mention the few sites that are running on free hosts?</p>

<p>I have currently 3 active blogs, 3 aggregators, 4 forums, a drupal communtiy site, 1 IM site and 1 myspaces resources site. Out off this 11 the only one that I need to really work on is only this blog which is one of the 3 active blogs. I post onces a day here, a scale down of 4 last year. The other 2 blogs are sports and technology which content can be easily found and updated without much writing. I update them every 2 or 3 days. I still working on the 3 aggregator sites, I don&#8217;t scrape full contents, but I am still unable to make it look like a news sites. These sites require very little of my time, most of the time I am working on the codes. The 4 forums are newly setup, I am promoting them and active anchoring them with interesting topics. I spend less than 30 mins on 4 of them each day. Drupal sites is stuck at design, I am not sure what to do with it yet. Myspaces resources requires no effort from me.</p>

<p>I feel if you found some spared time everyday, don&#8217;t waste it, start a new site. It can be a blog, a simple website or a forum. Who knows what might become of them a year later. Even if you have a job, you can easily manage 3 blogs, and if 1 make a $100 a month 3 will give you a spare cash of $300. Need $10,000 to replace your job, make 1000 websites.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8220;Boy, you got to pay attention to details!&#8221;. I just read the clickbank FAQ, I guess I am the last person on planet earth who missed this. I put all my clickbank affiliate links on iframe. If you don&#8217;t not what I taking about read the 2 clause below.</p>

<p><em><strong>10. Will I get referral credit if I hide hoplinks by making them open into a frame, iframe, layer, applet, image, or other sub-window object?</strong></em></p>

<p><em>No. These are illegal hoplinks. For security reasons, and to ensure proper tracking of your referrals, all hoplinks must be targeted to the top level of a new or existing window.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>11. What happens if I do make illegal hoplinks?</strong></em></p>

<p><em>The short answer is that if you make illegal hoplinks you will lose money.</em></p>

<p><em>Hoplinks targeted to frames or iframes are automatically retargeted to fill the top level of same window, with full affiliate referral credit awarded. Note that this retargeting may have the unintended effect of displacing your entire web site.</em></p>

<p><em>Hoplinks targeted to images or other invisible html objects give you no affilate referral credit at all. In some cases they will also prevent you from receiving affiliate referral credit for legal hoplinks on the same page.</em></p>

<p><em>Accounts that are found to be abusing the hoplink system may be terminated without notice.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Promoting a forum is no different than promoting any other site. Quality link building, content, advertisements, etc. You need to get the word out to as many people as you can, and you need the forum to be optimized for the search engines. Try participating in other forums similar to your niche. Don&#8217;t spam but rather participate constructively - you have better chances that your site gets noticed on your forum signature that way.</p>

<p>Attracting traffic to your site is easier than trying able to make those visitors register and participate. That would have to depend on how lively and useful the forum topics are in your forum. A simple way would be to invite friends, colleagues, family first into your forum to jump start the discussions. As conversations build up, a sense of community will also follow and your visitors will come back to your site almost religiously every day.
One of the ways to link building for forum is by submitting your forums to a list of good quality forum directories rather than general web directories. This directories are targeted at forum searchers. Here&#8217;s a list of good directories I found.</p>

<p>http://www.forumshowcase.com/
http://www.forumzilla.com/add.php **don&#8217;t list forums &lt;100 users
http://www.forumsinfo.com
http://www.foruma-z.com/addurl.php
http://www.bbswatch.com/index.shtml
http://www.bluenoserlinks.com/
http://www.findyourforum.com/
http://www.webmasters-central.com/
http://www.grandeforum.com/</p>

<p>Remember, you will not get a popular forum instantly&#8230; It involves hard work and patience.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are some good old post that offers great ideas on how to launch a  forum.</p>

<p>Ahmed Bilal offers some tips with this post <a href="http://performancing.com/how-to-launch-a-forum-on-your-blog">How to launch a forum on your blog</a>
_ # I hope you have friends as bloggers in your niche - leverage relationships to help give exposure to your forum through other blogs (note, you might want to offer an incentive - an offer for their readers, perhaps). It pays to make friends though._</p>

<p><em># Create linkbait in advance and publish them on the day the forum launches - then use the resulting attention and traffic and funnel it to the forum. It&#8217;s cheap, and requires some effort, but matched with your existing blogging community this tactic alone can give your forum the initial push it needs to survive.</em></p>

<p><em># Pre-populate the forum with some posts and threads so that it&#8217;s not totally empty. One tactic is to email regular readers and co-bloggers and get them to &#8216;start&#8217; on the forum a day or two before the actual launch. Real posts are always better than you creating 10 different IDs and posting under them.</em></p>

<p><em># Building up interest in the forum in advance is a no-brainer, but instead of putting up announcements about it run a competition and give out a prize, make the competition winnable only through the forum and then promote that prize / competition everywhere. It&#8217;s been done before, but it works.</em></p>

<p><em># Got some spare cash? Pay a popular blog to cover your forum - find a proper angle to suit that blogger&#8217;s audience if necessary.</em></p>

<p>Yaro Starak offers his advice on <a href="http://www.entrepreneurs-journey.com/568/how-to-launch-a-forum-with-an-instant-audience/">How To Launch A Forum With An Instant Audience</a>
_ &#8220;HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a strategy for launching a buzzing forum from day one - create an uber-popular blog first, then launch a forum and bring your existing blog audience over to it._</p>

<p><em>Steve Pavlina has done just that launching his brand new Personal Development for Smart People Forums. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s already reported explosive traffic growth at the forums and as I type this there are over 270 people on the forum with registrations numbers over 1000 and I expect the growth wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be stopping any time soon.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Other good launch idea are to offer discounts and prizes for those who post the most during a certain time. Rewards often attracts attention and creates buzz. I have seen forums offering some cash gift for people with highest posts every week and they do work well. It works very well and really does get the posting going.</p>
