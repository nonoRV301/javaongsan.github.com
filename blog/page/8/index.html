  <div class="entry-content"><p>Contrary to popular believe, you can&#8217;t make lots of money blogging. If you believe that writing a blog will eventually make you a six figure income and quick your job, this is going to hurt. I know you list all the six figure income bloggers and all your endless example to prove me   wrong. If you are one such blogger, I grantee your income is as low as your daily bus fare.</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t make money blogging, you make money marketing your blog. Make Sense? Income from blogs comes from ad placement. To sell and ad you need to market your blog. No advertiser will know that you have a blog and that you are selling ad space. To promote your blog, you need to do it at forums, other blog, social networking sites and build up your brand. Then you need traffic and readers to boast your revenue, you can&#8217;t get this by blogging. You get this done by doing  whole lot of other things.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After a few month of blogging, you find that you are stuck and you need to blog constantly to keep your traffic, revenue and readers. What happens when you need to spent time with your family during weekends, work overtime on a new project or go away on a trip? The best way would be to write you post in advance, stock them up for rainy days.</p>

<p>I used different method to generate posts. When you finish a post, take sometime to write another post on the same topic retaining   most of the content, giving it a different twist. These posts can be recall in the future when you need something urgently. Write a series of post about 5 to 7 surrounding a particular topic. This post can be used on occasions when you are away for a few days.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I read a book once titled &#8220;Get Real and Get rich&#8221; or something like that, I don&#8217;t remember the exact title. In the book the author relive that his secret to getting rich was by starting a part-time business, bidding on paint jobs on newly developed apartments. By bidding a $100 dollars lower than the lowest bid, he managed to saved enough money to start investing and finally achieved financial freedom. This is the only part of the story I remember, as I was trying to figure out how I can do the same but do it online. The first thought would be to make used of my programming skills and start offering my services, but if you to compare both. A website is dynamic, every project is different, requirement changes, its not like painting a house one after the other. What I need is to find something, that I could duplicate. The best approach is to develop a series of websites and sell them. Still, it requires hard work and a specialize skill.</p>

<p>Flipping website, is a concept which you buy a websites and sell it off at a higher value. To sell a website, we need to know what the buyers are looking for. Most buyers are looking for complete websites such as blog, forum, or community sites with revenue and traffic. The higher the traffic and revenue the higher the value. It seems like a simple plan but who in the right mind would sell off a profitable site for capital gain? Webmaster who have too many websites and unable to manage, owners who wants out, developer who developed sites for the purpose of capital gains. Not only it is rarely to find a good site but to out bid your competitors is tough. The next available option will be to buy turnkey websites which are sites that are newly developed. This site normally comes cheap generally below $50, have no revenue and no traffic. With a little effort in marketing and promotion, you can get this site profitable and sell them using the rule of 12/24 months revenue. If you make $50 with that site you can sell it for $600 or more. If you are familiar with programming, you can look out for uncompleted sites, finish it up and put it in the market for a quick but small profit.</p>

<p>Whatever you approach is, there are several things to note when buying a websites. Ask for verification of earnings and traffic, don&#8217;t just take the sellers word. Take a look at the site, make sure there are activities. Check the domain registry, what the cost involved in transferring a domain and what is the time frame. Sometimes transferring domain between different providers takes longer, while some providers are not supported. Newly register or changed domain can only be transfer after 60 days. The type hosting required needs to be clarified, some sites may have specific requirements that requires a special type of host. Always make it a point to have the seller ready to assist you in the upload if any things goes wrong.</p>

<p>While flipping websites may not make you millions but its a additional stream of revenue, but it adds to your arsenal of money making tools.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s the start of a new month and that means it&#8217;s time for do our income report. I been making money from blogging and other online marketing methods since May 2007. I always treat it as a game, trying to break new high score every month. I have made from varies source (see my <a href="http://wizcodersolution.com/2007/11/10/money-maker-2/">money makers</a>) but I did not manage to keep a steady source which look more like a hit and run.</p>

<p>During the new year I made decision to break the $300 mark and achieve $500 per month, and double it each month after. Keep in mind I have accumulated 14 sites now. So how did I do for Feburary.</p>

<p><strong>Total Income For Feburary 2008: $</strong><br/>
Adsense: $94.24<br/>
Ebook: $135<br/>
PaidPost: $38<br/>
Private ads: $90<br/>
Site Sales: $180<br/>
<strong>Total:537.24</strong></p>

<p>I have increased Adsense earning sharply because of the number of sites I have. I also make 2 new revenue stream from selling some sites I make and from private ads sales, this prove to be the most lucrative income. Using PPC I have increase Ebook sales but not as much as I want to. Paid Post is disapointing and tough work. I will only do paid post for offers that is $50 and above.</p>

<p>I was away most of the time in Feburary, It has become very difficult to blog and update my sites daily. One of my recurring problem is that my VPS tend to crash from time to time. I have reinstall my server and my site was down for a few days. My plan currently is to sell all my remaining <a href="http://wizcodersolution.com/2008/02/12/vps-down-for-24-hours/">11 sites</a>. I will sell this blog as well. There will be no more income report as I have not been able to generate any revenue form this blog. I have taken off all my ads.</p>

<p>Advertising expenses for the month was $30 and VPS Hosting $44.50. For next month, I will double the earning of this month.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Do you have only one website thats is bringing the cash now? Do you find it hard to increase the income from that site? If so, it may be time to set up another site theres complete different from what you are doing. Lets look at the types of sites we can set up.</p>

<p>Forum<br/>
Forum are the best source of passive income online, they require minimum management and most of the information are user contributed. The toughest thing about starting a forum is getting users to sign up and generate interesting topics. Revenue comes from private ad placement and ad networks.</p>

<p>Blog<br/>
Blog are the simplest to start. You write whatever you want. It the easy to get traffic. Revenue comes from a wide variety and is the most versatile of all.</p>

<p>Auto Blog<br/>
Its a blog that updates it self. A very effective way to make instant income but die as soon as it start making good profits.</p>

<p>Scripted Sites<br/>
Scripted Sites like myspace resources sites requires no maintainences makes primary income from Adsense. This site requires you to promote the site at the beginning.</p>

<p>These are some of the sites I have been playing with now. Whats are the type of sites you own?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To be an online business entrepreneur, one of the easiest ways to get started is with affiliate marketing. Affiliate marketing is to sell other peoples products and services and receive money. As an affiliate marketer, you sell either an advertiser&#8217;s product. You sign up with the company, are given a text link and usually nowadays, a host of graphics, banners and articles that relate to the company/product and you then have to promote it.</p>

<p>Affiliate marketing is one of the best income opportunities for several reason:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You Don&#8217;t Need Your Own Product</p></li>
<li><p>You don&#8217;t need to spend time creating a technically beautiful website</p></li>
<li><p>You don&#8217;t need to spend big bucks on great sales copy</p></li>
<li><p>You don&#8217;t need employees, or inventory, or any of the things that make a &#8220;business&#8221; a pain in the neck.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Does sound easy doesn&#8217;t it? Still many have fail, why? Affiliate marketing market is dynamic and constantly evolving. You need to keep pace to profits. The basics of affiliate marketing are Profitable Market, Products, Landing Page, Massive Traffic but these is only the basics. I have been studying successful marketers, most of them took an average of 6 months to figure out a successful campaign, they promote a minimum of 5 products in different niche, they spent up to $300 in pay-per-click search engine, they wrote tons of articles. One of the best affiliate marketers tutorial I have come across is Ewen Chia&#8217;s Autopilot Profits.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.squidoo.com/resize.php?1178870188&amp;filename=draft_lens1358693module2163138photo_big-bundle-small.jpg" alt="" />Ewen Chia&#8217;s Autopilot Profits really is a step by step, blue print for affiliate marketing and earning money online. If you are starting out this tutorial for you. Aim at internet marketing newbies Autopilot Profits consists of 6 video tutorials which can be watched online or downloaded, an Autopilot Profits eBook in PDF format, an Advertising eBook in PDF format and keywords / keyword phrases for use in your PPC campaigns.</p>

<p>The video titles are:<br/>
1 - Autopilot Profits: Is It Really Doable?<br/>
2 - Finding The Hungry Crowd<br/>
3 - Feeding The Hungry<br/>
4a - Marketing Your Product: Site Setup And Redirects<br/>
4b - Marketing Your Product: Fast Traffic Techniques<br/>
4c - Marketing Your Product: Long-Term Traffic Techniques<br/>
5 - Putting It All On Autopilot<br/>
6 - How to Set Up Your Own Instant Turnkey Profit-Printing Money Machine Now</p>

<p>I found the videos and chapters to be laid out logically with each one building on the information covered in the previous chapter. Obviously the video tutorials should be watched in order and in conjunction with reading the relevant chapter in the Autopilot Profits book. If you download the videos you can always review them any time a question arises about a particular topic covered in the Autopilot Profits tutorial.<br/>
