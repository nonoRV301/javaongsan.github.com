  <div class="entry-content"><p>Do you have only one website thats is bringing the cash now? Do you find it hard to increase the income from that site? If so, it may be time to set up another site theres complete different from what you are doing. Lets look at the types of sites we can set up.</p>

<p>Forum<br/>
Forum are the best source of passive income online, they require minimum management and most of the information are user contributed. The toughest thing about starting a forum is getting users to sign up and generate interesting topics. Revenue comes from private ad placement and ad networks.</p>

<p>Blog<br/>
Blog are the simplest to start. You write whatever you want. It the easy to get traffic. Revenue comes from a wide variety and is the most versatile of all.</p>

<p>Auto Blog<br/>
Its a blog that updates it self. A very effective way to make instant income but die as soon as it start making good profits.</p>

<p>Scripted Sites<br/>
Scripted Sites like myspace resources sites requires no maintainences makes primary income from Adsense. This site requires you to promote the site at the beginning.</p>

<p>These are some of the sites I have been playing with now. Whats are the type of sites you own?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To be an online business entrepreneur, one of the easiest ways to get started is with affiliate marketing. Affiliate marketing is to sell other peoples products and services and receive money. As an affiliate marketer, you sell either an advertiser&#8217;s product. You sign up with the company, are given a text link and usually nowadays, a host of graphics, banners and articles that relate to the company/product and you then have to promote it.</p>

<p>Affiliate marketing is one of the best income opportunities for several reason:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You Don&#8217;t Need Your Own Product</p></li>
<li><p>You don&#8217;t need to spend time creating a technically beautiful website</p></li>
<li><p>You don&#8217;t need to spend big bucks on great sales copy</p></li>
<li><p>You don&#8217;t need employees, or inventory, or any of the things that make a &#8220;business&#8221; a pain in the neck.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Does sound easy doesn&#8217;t it? Still many have fail, why? Affiliate marketing market is dynamic and constantly evolving. You need to keep pace to profits. The basics of affiliate marketing are Profitable Market, Products, Landing Page, Massive Traffic but these is only the basics. I have been studying successful marketers, most of them took an average of 6 months to figure out a successful campaign, they promote a minimum of 5 products in different niche, they spent up to $300 in pay-per-click search engine, they wrote tons of articles. One of the best affiliate marketers tutorial I have come across is Ewen Chia&#8217;s Autopilot Profits.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.squidoo.com/resize.php?1178870188&amp;filename=draft_lens1358693module2163138photo_big-bundle-small.jpg" alt="" />Ewen Chia&#8217;s Autopilot Profits really is a step by step, blue print for affiliate marketing and earning money online. If you are starting out this tutorial for you. Aim at internet marketing newbies Autopilot Profits consists of 6 video tutorials which can be watched online or downloaded, an Autopilot Profits eBook in PDF format, an Advertising eBook in PDF format and keywords / keyword phrases for use in your PPC campaigns.</p>

<p>The video titles are:<br/>
1 - Autopilot Profits: Is It Really Doable?<br/>
2 - Finding The Hungry Crowd<br/>
3 - Feeding The Hungry<br/>
4a - Marketing Your Product: Site Setup And Redirects<br/>
4b - Marketing Your Product: Fast Traffic Techniques<br/>
4c - Marketing Your Product: Long-Term Traffic Techniques<br/>
5 - Putting It All On Autopilot<br/>
6 - How to Set Up Your Own Instant Turnkey Profit-Printing Money Machine Now</p>

<p>I found the videos and chapters to be laid out logically with each one building on the information covered in the previous chapter. Obviously the video tutorials should be watched in order and in conjunction with reading the relevant chapter in the Autopilot Profits book. If you download the videos you can always review them any time a question arises about a particular topic covered in the Autopilot Profits tutorial.<br/>

I no expert in Tri but I do not recommend getting expensive equipment for starter. Who knows when you will quit and what will become of your equipment? For your first race, its to get a feel of what its like and whether you want to continue to pursue this. After each tri event, I see first timer selling off their brand new equipment at lower prize and quiting the sport.</p>

Swim<br/>
Goggles<br/>
Swim trunks / suit - no need to invest in a tri suit<br/>
swim cap are provided by organisers</p>

<p>Bike<br/>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wikipedia describe entrepreneur as An entrepreneur is a person who operates a new enterprise or venture and assumes some accountability for the inherent risks. If you have line up all the successful entrepreneur in the world and tried to profile them, you find that they all different. From the size, looks, to the way they think and operate. There are no fixed rule to become an entrepreneur, but at some point you be required to take risks or perform and work in a way that most peers will not. If you go back to all the successful entrepreneurs and ask them for the key to their success, you probably get as many as the number of people you asked. How do become successful? We do it by failing more than others and we get up each time. Technical skills like marketing, writing business plan, managing can be learn but attitude and commitment are forged through countless hardship, visualization, developing passion and undying attitude. What the most important thing you can do to be a successful entrepreneur is simply &#8220;Don&#8217;t Quit&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I seem to lost a few days post from all my blogs. Some post are really good and I don&#8217;t have a backup. It must been ease when the support staffs are rolling the backups. Well looks like I need to put some really good contents back. Since I can&#8217;t do it as I will be away for most of the time, I figure a blog contest is the best way to bring in the guest post. Ok the 4 125x125 ads space is up for grads again in March.</p>

<p>The contest is simply, just <a href="mailto:admin@wizcodersolution.com">email</a> your post to me and the highest hit post wins. The winner gets the 125x125 ads space on my sidebar for the entire month of March. Your post must be 250 words long and you may include 1 links to your website. Blog post can be of any topic, as long as its not adult. Did I miss anything?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The problem most people face when starting a weight lose workout is consistency. Most people set unrealistic goals and when they don&#8217;t reach them, it&#8217;s an excuse to give up. New research out of the University of California at Berkeley of more than 20,000 runners found that the people who quit on or took &#8220;breaks&#8221; from their fitness plans put on abnormal amounts of weight that they couldn&#8217;t easily knock off. So stick to your plan. No Excuses!</p>

<p>PUMP IT OUT<br/>
Weight training are the best fat basters and even cardio can&#8217;t match it. A research from Boston University shows that  muscles developed through strength and weight training, burn fat as readily as hours on an elliptical.</p>

<p>GET FIT IN JUST 3 WORKOUTS A WEEK<br/>
Nutrition is more important than your exercise habits. You are what you eat. Make sure you stick with whole, natural foods, such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, fish, and protein to set the foundation. For your exercise sessions, focus on quality and intensity, not quantity. Exercising 3 days a week for only 45 minutes or less. Strengthen your entire body with multi-muscle resistance exercises and burn fat by using short-burst interval training.  Follow that up with stretches for tight muscle groups only.</p>
