  <div class="entry-content"><p>Forums can be a great way to create more profit for your business. The big forums can make a fortune but unless you can generate 1,000s of visitors a day forget it. One of the key factors for profitable forums is getting people to sign up. If you have no visitors or members, your forum will never grow. You need people in your forum and you need them to be talking about things that will get others to join in. You need make things interesting and create topics that people are interested in. Nonone will join an empty forums. You need to invest time to make your forum look professional.</p>

<p>Make it Easy to Join
First make the registration process as easy as possible. Just ask for username, name and email address for a start. Make it in a way members can fill out their full profile at a later date.</p>

<p>Get Subscribers Early
DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wait for opening day to get people to sign up for your forum. You can get friends and current customers to post early and help you test it; then, when people come to your forum for the first time, it will already appear active.</p>

<p>Promoting your forum on other forum
Other related forum can be a good place to promote your forum but be careful to not to look as thought you are snatching their members. Add a link to it in your signature where the forum users there can also offer their opinions at your.</p>

<p>Make active members moderators
Once your have a pool of active users, look for the most active one make them moderators. This will make them feel like they are part of your forum community and take the work of moderating for spam of your hand.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most people understand the basics of SEO and generating traffic. You need good content that people are looking for and keep the contents updated. Many SEO followers would start a blog because of this reason however generating content is never easy, a blog post needs to be a mnum of 200 words to be of any effects. One of the easiest way to do generate content without your own effort is to start a forum,  where subscribers create the content for you instead. I am sure that everyone knows about the value of having a forum. A forum is a community of a particular chosen niche that helps to generate revenue, rank higher on search engines. With lots of information and discussion being exchanged in your forums visitors will return again and again to see replies to their posts, read others posts and basically to see if anything has changed or if opinions have swayed to their side. A forum can be a place for people to discuss issues, share knowledge and generate relationships.</p>

<p>The very first thing to do is to decide a niche topic for your forum. I suggest you only consider starting a forum site about something that you have a strong interest in yourself. There are a surprising number of headaches running a forum. Even with the income I wouldn&#8217;t do it if I did not enjoy the topic. A hot tip on creating a good forum is to start a forum in a smaller niche where few quality boards exist. This will attract your core audience to discuss about a certain topic of interest. Do not add too many sub forums and keep all sub topics related to the your niche.</p>

<p>When starting up the first technical thing to consider is the platform for the forum. There are so many forum scripts you can choose from. Normally I prefer free forum scripts in php like phpBB3 which can ran on both windows and linux and they are provided by most web hosting companies. I would suggest you to start off with a free forum script, you can always migrate to other softwares later. Next, you need a reliable host for your forum, you can start off with basic package that cost around $4 a month and upgrade it when your forum grows. Now that you have everything setup, you just need to get visitors to join as a member.</p>

ShoppingAds is a hybrid product that serves both CPA (cost per action) ads provided by eBay and CPC (cost per click) ads provided by our shopping comparison engine partners. For existing AuctionAds users the only change you will see is the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ads By AuctionAdsÃ¢â‚¬  displayed on your ads will change to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ads By ShoppingAdsÃ¢â‚¬ .

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the constant struggle of webmaster is trying to  increase website traffic. No traffic is ever enough, when traffic stop growing, the income of the website stops as well. One of the best way increased traffic, sign ups or sales with no cost is using traffic exchange. <a href="http://javaongsan.github.com/recommends/trafficswarm/">TrafficSwarm</a> is one of the largest traffic exchange out there.</p>

<p><strong>What is <a href="http://javaongsan.github.com/recommends/trafficswarm/">TrafficSwarm</a></strong>
First of all What is traffic exchange? A traffic exchange basically allows members to trade views of their websites. Members join the program and earns credit by clicking on a advertisement that will lead to another website. When you accumulate enough credit, you will be able to put in an advertisement for your own website. <a href="http://javaongsan.github.com/recommends/trafficswarm/">TrafficSwarm</a> has been one my favorite and most effective traffic source. It is a bit different than others because it allows you to look at a group of classified ads first before clicking on the ones you want to see.</p>

<p><strong>Setting Up An Advertisement</strong>
To set up your advertisement, on the bottom of the page and you&#8217;ll find Manage Your Site Promotions. This is where you add your own website URLs for others to see. You can select which category where your ads will appear.</p>

<p><strong>Earn More Credits</strong>
To accumulate more credits you need to surf other sites, each sites pays 1-5 credits randomly. You can also earn a 100 free credits when you refer new members.  As with all similar programs on the web there&#8217;s a free version and a pro version.  To get optimum benefit it&#8217;s recommended that you use the pro version.  If you want to earn more credits simply upgrade to Pro member which cost $30 a month. Pro member benefits include better ad display, more credits per clicks, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Income Results</strong>
Total number of visitors sent to my site on Dec 07: 104
Time spent to generate 100 credits perday: 30min
Total number sales: 2
Cost: $0 (I just upgraded to the Pro version for more traffic, but even the Pro version costs about a buck a day.)
Sale conversion rate: 2 in 104
Profit from TrafficSwarm: $54</p>

<p>The best part is that this program is actually worth the PRO upgrade. At $30 per month, in just one week, I make enough commissions to cover this cost.</p>

<p><strong>Advance Techniques</strong>
I used a rather straight forward approach in catching sales. I direct my <a href="http://javaongsan.github.com/recommends/trafficswarm/">TrafficSwarm</a> traffic to my sales page. However, an effective lead capturing method is to used a squeeze page to capture leads. A squeeze page consist of a free bonus which will be given to users when they fill up and submit the opt-in forms. The email list can then be used to promote different products, as the list gets bigger so does your profit.</p>

<p>If you need traffic to your website or your client&#8217;s websites, try <a href="http://javaongsan.github.com/recommends/trafficswarm/">TrafficSwarm</a> today. Sign up for the Pro version if you are serious in a good traffic generator. New joiners are given with 100 free credits as  a bonus.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&#8217;re outside of North America, Latin America, and Japan, AdSense referrals will be retired. I wonder why?</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re in North America, Latin America, or Japan, the pricing structure for AdSense referrals is changing. Now Adsense no longer will be offering the $5 bonus or $2000 bonus, and the payout for referring a user who generates $100 with AdSense in the first 180 days will return to $100.</p>

<p>These changes will take place during the last week of January.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A referred user who reaches $100 within 180 days of signing up and who removes all payments holds before the change occurs will generate earnings of $250 for the referring publisher.</p></li>
<li><p>Any referred user who meets this conversion criteria after the change occurs will only generate $100 in earnings for the referring publisher. In addition, the $5 bonus will be removed at that time.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Do you make use of AdSense referral? How will this changes affect you?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Guy Kawasaki wrote an interesting review on the recently published The Illusions of Entrepreneurship: The Costly Myths That Entrepreneurs, Investors, and Policy Makers Live By Scott Shane of Case Western  .</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300113315?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wizcoder-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0300113315">

Says he, Ã¢â‚¬Å“People start businesses based on the myths we tell ourselves about entrepreneurship and then are hurt when confronted by reality. Investors believe these myths and invest money and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re disappointed when they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hold true. Policy makers make policy based on these myths and then wonder why the economy isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t growing with all these entrepreneurs now in it.Ã¢â‚¬  If you think you already really know the scoop about entrepreneurship, try taking his <a href="http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/entrepreneurshipquiz.asp">test</a></em>.<em> If you score less than 80%, maybe you should buy the book.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finally gotten the email on the much talk about <a href="http://bdv.bidvertiser.com/bidvertiser/referral_button.html?pid=57114">Bidvertiser</a> ads on rss feed.
Here are the steps to create a new rss feed url with bidvertiser ad:
1. Login to your publisher account and click &#8220;Add New BidVertiser&#8221;. During the Public Beta, you may also click the &#8220;Public Beta&#8221; link. If you are new to BidVertiser, click here to create a publisher account.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make sure you are under the BidVertiser for your Feed tab.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide your feed URL and title and click Next.</p></li>
<li><p>Verify your feed ownership by adding a temporary post with a unique verification code we provide you with.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose your favorite multiple-subscription Feed Widget and add it to your website or blog. Detail instructions for each of the major blog platforms is provided as part of the process.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The problem now is trying to get all your subscriber to subscribe to your new feed. I certainly not using this, I have been experiencing a sharp decline of rss suscriber. I think its time to kick in another gear and break that 1000 rss count limit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Did you know you can add articles from other source to your blog to help draw traffic to it? By adding good quality content to your blog, not only can you perform better in organic traffic, you can attract more readers to your site faster. Yes, we are talking about finding keyword articles to boast our traffics.</p>

<p>These keywords can improve the volume and quality of traffic to a web site from search engines via &#8220;natural&#8221; (&#8220;organic&#8221; or &#8220;algorithmic&#8221;) search results. Usually, the higher a site is presented in the search results, the more searchers will visit that site. To scrape articles is easy, you can use free content from article directory, hire a writer, or get it from other blogs. All you need is to give credits to the original author. I suggest you scrape about 30 articles in one go and spread them out in your archives, that means creating this content in past dates. To get index fast you need to submit your new sitemap to <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/">Google Webmaster Central.</a></p>

<p>You be seeing some exciting traffic pretty soon, if you get your keywords right, you can get about 50-100 unique organic traffic per day.</p>
