  <div class="entry-content"><p>Controlling winform for multi-user application can be easy achieve by limiting menu access based on login user.
Most of the time, a role is required because many user have the same access rights. We can either add this manually or have everything store in an database.</p>

<pre><code>```

foreach (ToolStripItem item in menuStrip1.Items)
{
    item.Enabled = RoleAccess.IsEnable(RoleId);
    item.Visible = RoleAccess.IsEnable(RoleId);
}

```

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is not a guide, I do not have a profitable product yet, This is a collection for my own references.</p>

<p>If you been freelancing for a while, chances are you get the itch sometimes to create your own software product. For a freelance programmer, the best way to create recurring income is to create your own software product.</p>

<p>How do we go about creating an software product. First, find your niche. A niche is a group of people with the same behavior, in software sense, they use the same type of software to perform a common task.</p>

<p>When you have selected a niche, its time to do some research. Research your customers, look at what products they own, how much are they paying for. Go to forums, user groups, on facebook, twitter and linkedin. Find out what are their problems, pains, desires.</p>

<h2>Generating Ideas for software.</h2>

<p>Automated a time consuming task, build a companion to a task they need to automate e.g. a application that replace then need for a user to manually checking website related to their trade that do not provide filtering or email alerts.</p>

<p>Another great way to build software is to start out by solving your own problems. find other people who had the same problem. Look at what they are doing to solve it.</p>

<p>Look at what you are currently doing and what are your customer paying you to solve. Can some one else use it?</p>

<p>If someone have ask you about a certain kind of solution more than once, start taking notes.</p>

<p>Build your prototype, use agile methodology, start small learn and iterate. Then you&#8217;ll be able to build a product your customer truly love.</p>

<h1>For the next 30 days, find at least one problem per day. Record it.</h1>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I been asking a few times to take equity instead of cash to help with the development of mostly startups or those who wants to do start up.
I would definitely take equity if a right project I like comes along.</p>

<p>My rules are :
1. If project have good potential and generates income right form the start, I take equity.
2. If project have good potential and may generate income in distant future, I take small equity plus small upfront cash.
3. If project have no potential, I charge full development cost.
4. Reject anything else thats a waste of time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most people just waste time on LinkedIn, browsing randomly and sending out odd connection requests hoping to land a jobs. Most of them are looking the wrong way. The secret is in LinkedIn Groups. LinkedIn Groups are a very good way to get more clients for your freelance business. LinkedIn has over 200 million users, most groups have at least a thousand members and you can tap into this crowd to find your target customers. There always people looking to solve a problem. Join groups related to your industries and participate in the problem solving not join random discussion, and soon you be the expert of the group and most people will go directly to you.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This month was my second year as a freelance programmer. This are somethings that have worked well.</p>

<h2>Recurring income</h2>

<p>Always ask for more work from existing client. Charge a monthly for maintenances if you can.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<p>Macbook air, Dell 23 inch have been the best investment ever. I hope to get a new MBA with more ram than the current 4g and a 27i nch Monitor thats now cost less than $500. A mac pro would be ideal but a spec up one is really costly.</p>

<h2>Skills</h2>

<p>C#, PHP and javascript are the most common skill I am using. I write a lot python scripts to process things.</p>

<h2>Networking</h2>

<p>I attended a lot more events and hackathons. I make some really good connections.</p>

<h2>learning</h2>

<p>I learn a lot of marketing techniques since.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I started freelancing I did not have a constant flow of clients. I search job boards, forums and classified ads, there were not many jobs and it was hard to convert those prospects into clients. I didn&#8217;t know what to do.</p>

<p>Since then I have gather a few methods from various freelancer and marketers I came across that have work well.</p>

<h2>Define The Types of Client</h2>

<p>For me a good client will be someone for pays $5000 or more for a single project. Loosely translate to $500 per man-day charge. Anything less are just not worth the time and effort even if I have no income. Recurring revenue is another thing that I would focus on. Clients I take on should be coming back to me for more work.</p>

<h2>Lead Source</h2>

<p>Leads can be generated through:
1. On-line classified ads.
This are slow, and may generate 1 or 2 leads per month, but maintenances is easy. Most of the ads run for a month, then you go back and turn it on again. Use Google calender to set reminders, keep the url in the calender, so when an reminder is send, all you need to do is click the url.
2. Blog
It takes a lot effort to get ranked in the search engine. Some SEO knowledge required here
3. PPC Paid Ads
Using Adwords and facebook ads can generate the fastest and most relevant leads.
4. Linkedin
People are always looking for someone good in certain skill set. Setting up a good profile can help generate a fair amount of traffic</p>

<h2>Building the list</h2>

<p>Now you have gather all the source, you need channel them to a place where you can keep build relationships. Use an opt-in list builder like mailchimp. Set up a landing page to catch all that traffic. Set up an series of emails.</p>

<h1>Other more manual generation</h1>

<p>Responding to wanted ads, forum query and user groups and posting links back to your blog post which eventually end up on your landing page.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>More programmers are try their hands at freelancing full-time. They are driven by the dream to be independent and living without a 9-to-5 job constraints. Does a full-time freelancer get to work he you want, take vacations when you want, for as long as he wants. For me its not, I start freelancing 2 years ago, this are somethings I learn along the way. If you&#8217;re looking to start freelancing and not sure how you can go about it, then read on.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>Decide why you want to freelance. More time for family, more time for health, less commuting, no office politics, no more long boring meetings or the comfort of working from your own home. Knowing your motivation will help will go through tough times and taking full time employment again.</p>

<h2>Finding work</h2>

<p>The one most ask question I get when I introduce my self as a freelancer is &#8220;How to get work?&#8221;. Well, there are a few ways to find work:
1. Referral from a friends, family member, Ex-Employees, Ex-Colleagues or just about anyone you knows.
2. Your Website or Blog
3. From online job boards or on a freelance website like Elance, ODesk, or Freelancer.com
4. From online classified ads.
All of the above requires constantly looking, goggling, searching and talking to people. It will probably take up more time then development before you get your first 3 clients. I have the most success getting referrals from ex-colleagues and ex-employers.</p>

<h2>Whats my rate?</h2>

<p>The next most important thing is how much to charge? Working out how much to charge clients is very difficult. I would recommend you work out you hourly rate. Try this formula if you are having trouble determine you hourly rate. Take your highest monthly pay, divide it by the number of working days, divide the result by 8, then increase it by 20%. You should get a reasonable hourly rate. Remember if you have low rate, you have a hard time trying to raise it later on.</p>

<p>To sum it up, as a freelancer, your next paycheck is never guaranteed. You are always searching for your next project while you chase the payment of the previous one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How does one go about getting work as a Freelance developer? The number one question I get when I introduce my self as a freelancer is &#8220;How to get work?&#8221;. Most freelancer start out having no idea how to find new clients.</p>

<p>I have mention 4 ways to find work in the previous post:
1. Referral from a friends, family member, Ex-Employees, Ex-Colleagues or just about anyone you knows.
2. Your Website or Blog
3. From online job boards or on a freelance website like Elance, ODesk, or Freelancer.com
4. From online classified ads.
All of the above requires constantly looking, goggling, searching and talking to people. It will probably take up more time then development before you get your first 3 clients. I have the most success getting referrals from ex-colleagues and ex-employers.</p>

<p>Because all these looking and searching for new client may takes time, you will need a remember a few things when you get your client:
1. Keep existing client, generate recurring revenue form them, or at least keep the relationship going.
2. Keep billing organize, bill on time because chasing payments are painful.
3. Ask for referral from existing client.</p>

<p>Be the go to person for your expertise is the eaiuest way to get referral. Put effort in your work, give extra values. If you did a good job that client will tell others and getting new business will be easier.</p>

<p>What I am achieving is to create a lead generation channel, an automated system that constantly bring in and qualifies new clients. I share this in the future posts.</p>

<p>You need to think about what type of clients you want to work with. Find clients who wants your skill sets. Identify these clients? What sort of projects do they need completed? How they spend their time? Get your portfolio in front of them. If you know where they spend their time, you can contribute to the publications they read, meet them at the right networking events and even attend their industry conferences.</p>
